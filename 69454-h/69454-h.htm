<hr class='c005'>

<p class='c006'>The signs are, that both the moral and the religious systems
of the future will be greatly modified by the advance
of science. They will be more and more conformed to the
facts of nature; not only to the facts which a diligent Materialism,
working in a single direction, has brought to light,
but to the transcendent facts which Modern Spiritualism
has restored and proved. The one order of facts is incomplete
without the other; and Materialism is as surely
doomed to be encircled and transfigured by the wider
horizon of Spiritualism, as the Ptolemaic system of the
universe was doomed to be superseded by the Copernican.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unpopular facts often encounter an opposition quite as
persistent as that which follows unpopular theories; and so
intelligent Spiritualists are not disturbed by the antagonism
which their facts have met with from the Huxleys, Tyndalls,
Carpenters, and Büchners of our day. All these men,
working as they are for science in their different ways,
though under the disadvantage of an ignorance of certain
phenomena of vast significance, are welcomed as fellow-laborers
in the cause of truth by Spiritualists; for the latter,
relying on their facts, are confident that genuine Science
includes them all, and that every new discovery must be in
harmony with all that they hold as true. Opposition to the
phenomena, proceeding as it does from lack of knowledge,
simply indicates the magnitude and astonishing character
of the facts themselves, which could excite such incredulity
in the face of such overwhelming testimony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the men of science who have either admitted the
facts, or both the facts and the theory, of Spiritualism, are
Hare, chemist; Varley, F. R. S., electrician; Flammarion,
astronomer; Crookes, F. R. S., chemist; Hoefle, author of
the “History of Chemistry;” Nichols, chemist; Fichte, philosopher;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>Liais, astronomer; Hermann Goldschmidt, astronomer,
and the discoverer of fourteen planets; Von Esenbach,
the greatest modern German botanist; Huggins, F. R. S.,
astronomer and spectroscopist; De Morgan, mathematician;
Dille, physicist; Elliotson, Ashburner, and Gray, physicians
and surgeons. To no one eminent man of science, however,
has Spiritualism been more indebted than to Alfred
Russell Wallace, F. R. S., distinguished for his researches
in natural history, paleontology, and anthropology. His
“Defence of Spiritualism,” here presented, appeared originally
in the London Fortnightly Review for May and June,
1874. Containing as it does the latest facts, no better tract
for Spiritualists to offer as an answer to their opponents has
yet appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wallace, though he arrived, simultaneously with
Mr. Darwin, at similar conclusions in regard to the origin
of species, differs from him on a most important point; for
Mr. Wallace believes that “a superior intelligence is necessary
to account for man.” His acquaintance with the phenomena
of Spiritualism must always give him, in the sweep
and comprehensiveness of his anthropology, a great advantage
over Mr. Darwin. Besides his great work on the
“Natural History of the Malay Archipelago,” and an account
of his “Explorations on the Amazon,” Mr. Wallace is the
author of “The Theory of Natural Selection,” and of many
valuable papers in scientific journals. Dr. Hooker, president
of the British Scientific Association, wrote, in 1868,
“Of Mr. Wallace, and his many contributions to philosophical
biology, it is not easy to speak without enthusiasm;
for, putting aside their great merits, he, throughout his many
writings, with a modesty as rare as I believe it to be in him
unconscious, forgets his own unquestionable claims to the
honor of having originated, independently of Mr. Darwin,
the theories which he so ably defends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The testimony of such an investigator as Mr. Wallace
in behalf of the stupendous phenomena of Spiritualism is
not to be lightly put aside or ignored. What can be said in
reply to such an array of facts as he presents?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is with great diffidence, but under an imperative sense of
duty, that the present writer accepts the opportunity afforded
him of submitting to his readers some general account of a
widespread movement, which, though for the most part
treated with ridicule or contempt, he believes to embody
truths of the most vital importance to human progress.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The
subject to be treated is of such vast extent, the evidence
concerning it is so varied and so extraordinary, the prejudices
that surround it are so inveterate, that it is not possible
to do it justice without entering into considerable detail.
The reader who ventures on the perusal of the succeeding
pages may, therefore, have his patience tried; but if he
is able to throw aside his preconceived ideas of what is
possible and what is impossible, and in the acceptance or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>rejection of the evidence submitted to him will carefully
weigh and be solely guided by the nature of the concurrent
testimony, the writer ventures to believe that he will not
find his time and patience ill bestowed.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The following are the more important works which have been used in
the preparation of this article: Judge Edmonds’s “Spiritual Tracts,”

<p class='c007'>Few men, in this busy age, have leisure to read massive
volumes devoted to special subjects. They gain much of their
general knowledge, outside the limits of their profession or of
any peculiar study, by means of periodical literature; and, as
a rule, they are supplied with copious and accurate, though
general, information. Some of our best thinkers and workers
make known the results of their researches to the readers of
magazines and reviews; and it is seldom that a writer whose
information is meagre, or obtained at second-hand, is permitted
to come before the public in their pages as an authoritative
teacher. But as regards the subject we are now about to
consider, this rule has not hitherto been followed. Those who
have devoted many years to an examination of its phenomena
have been, in most cases, refused a hearing; while men who
have bestowed on it no adequate attention, and are almost
wholly ignorant of the researches of others, have alone supplied
the information to which a large proportion of the public
have had access. In support of this statement it is necessary
to refer, with brief comments, to some of the more prominent
articles in which the phenomena and pretensions of
Spiritualism have been recently discussed.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of the present year the readers of this
Review were treated to “Experiences of Spiritualism,” by a
writer of no mean ability, and of thoroughly advanced views.
He assures his readers that he “conscientiously endeavored
to qualify himself for speaking on this subject” by attending
five séances, the details of several of which he narrates; and
he comes to the conclusion that mediums are by no means ingenious
deceivers, but “jugglers of the most vulgar order;”
that the “spiritualistic mind falls a victim to the most patent
frauds,” and greedily “accepts jugglery as manifestations of
spirits”; and, lastly, that the mediums are as credulous as
their dupes, and fall straightway into any trap that is laid for
them. Now, on the evidence before him, and on the assumption
that no more or better evidence would have been forthcoming
had he devoted fifty instead of five evenings to the inquiry,
the conclusions of Lord Amberley are perfectly logical;
but, so far from what he witnessed being a “specimen of the
kind of manifestations by which Spiritualists are convinced,”
a very little acquaintance with the literature of the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>would have shown him that no Spiritualist of any mark was
ever convinced by any quantity of such evidence. In an article
published since Lord Amberley’s—in London Society for
February—the author, a barrister and well-known literary
man, says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was difficult for me to give in to the idea that solid objects
could be conveyed, invisibly, through closed doors, or
that heavy furniture could be moved without the interposition
of hands. Philosophers will say these things are absolutely
impossible; nevertheless, it is absolutely certain that
they do occur. I have met in the houses of private friends,
as witnesses of these phenomena, persons whose testimony
would go for a good deal in a court of justice. They have included
peers, members of parliament, diplomatists of the highest
rank, judges, barristers, physicians, clergymen, members
of learned societies, chemists, engineers, journalists, and
thinkers of all sorts and degrees. They have suggested and
carried into effect tests of the most rigid and satisfactory character.
The media (all non-professional) have been searched
before and after séances. The precaution has even been
taken of providing them unexpectedly with other apparel.
They have been tied; they have been sealed; they have been
secured in every cunning and dexterous manner that ingenuity
could devise, but no deception has been discovered and no
imposture brought to light. Neither was there any motive
for imposture. No fee or reward of any kind depended upon
the success or non-success of the manifestations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now here we have a nice question of probabilities. We
must either believe that Lord Amberley is almost infinitely
more acute than Mr. Dunphy and his host of eminent friends—so
that after five séances (most of them failures) he has got
to the bottom of a mystery in which they, notwithstanding
their utmost endeavors, still hopelessly flounder—or, that the
noble lord’s acuteness does not surpass the combined acuteness
of all these persons; in which case their much larger experience,
and their having witnessed many things Lord Amberley
has not witnessed, must be held to have the greater
weight, and to show, at all events, that all mediums are not
“jugglers of the most vulgar order.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In October last the New Quarterly Magazine, in its opening
number, had an article entitled “A Spiritualistic Séance;”
but which proved to be an account of certain ingenious contrivances
by which some of the phenomena usual at séances
were imitated, and both Spiritualists and skeptics deceived
and confounded. This appears at first sight to be an exposure
of Spiritualism, but it is really very favorable to its pretensions;
for it goes on the assumption that the marvelous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>phenomena witnessed do really occur, but are produced by
various mechanical contrivances. In this case the rooms
above, below, and at the side of that in which the séance was
held had to be prepared with specially constructed machinery,
with assistants to work it. The apparatus, as described,
would cost at least £100, and would then only serve to produce
a few fixed phenomena, such as happen frequently in private
houses and at the lodgings of mediums who have not exclusive
possession of any of the adjoining rooms, or the means of
obtaining expensive machinery and hired assistants. The article
bears internal evidence of being altogether a fictitious
narrative; but it helps to demonstrate, if any demonstration
is required, that the phenomena which occur under such protean
forms and varied conditions, and in private houses quite
as often as at the apartments of the mediums, are in no way
produced by machinery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the most prominent recent attack on Spiritualism
was that in the Quarterly Review for October, 1871, which is
known to have been written by an eminent physiologist, and
did much to blind the public to the real nature of the movement.
This article, after giving a light sketch of the reported
phenomena, entered into some details as to planchette-writing
and table-lifting—facts on which no Spiritualist depends
as evidence to a third party—and then proceeded to define its
standpoint as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our position, then, is that the so-called spiritual communications
come from <em>within</em>, not from without, the individuals
who suppose themselves to be the recipients of them; that
they belong to the class termed ‘subjective’ by physiologists
and psychologists, and that the movements by which they are
expressed, whether the tilting of tables or the writing of
planchettes, are really produced by their own muscular action
exerted independently of their own wills and quite unconsciously
to themselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Several pages are then devoted to accounts of séances
which, like Lord Amberley’s, were mostly failures; and to the
experiences of a Bath clergyman who believed that the communications
came from devils; and, generally, such weak
and inconclusive phenomena only are adduced as can be
easily explained by the well-worn formulæ of “unconscious
cerebration,” “expectant attention,” and “unconscious muscular
action.” A few of the more startling physical phenomena
are mentioned merely to be discredited and the judgment
of the witnesses impugned; but no attempt is made to
place before the reader any information as to the amount or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the weight of the testimony to such phenomena, or to the long
series of diverse phenomena which lead up to and confirm
them. Some of the experiments of Prof. Hare and Mr.
Crookes are quoted and criticised in the spirit of assuming
that these experienced physicists were ignorant of the simplest
principles of mechanics, and failed to use the most ordinary
precautions. Of the numerous and varied cases on
record, of heavy bodies being moved without direct or indirect
contact by any human being, no notice is taken, except
so far as quoting Mr. C. F. Varley’s statement, that he had
seen, in broad daylight, a small table moved ten feet, with
no one near it but himself, and not touched by him—“as an
example of the manner in which minds of this limited order
are apt to become the dupes of their own imaginings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This article, like the others here referred to, shows in the
writer an utter forgetfulness of the maxim, that an argument
is not answered till it is answered at its best. Amid
the vast mass of recorded facts now accumulated by Spiritualists,
there is, of course, much that is weak and inconclusive,
much that is of no value as evidence, except to those
who have independent reasons for faith in them. From this
undigested mass it is the easiest thing in the world to pick
out arguments that can be refuted and facts that can be explained
away; but what is that to the purpose? It is not
these that have convinced any one; but those weightier, oft-repeated
and oft-tested facts which the writers referred to invariably
ignore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prof. Tyndall has also given the world (in his “Fragments
of Science,” published in 1871) some account of his attempt
to investigate these phenomena. Again, we have a
minute record of a séance which was a failure, and in which
the Professor, like Lord Amberley, easily imposed on some
too credulous Spiritualists by improvising a few manifestations
of his own. The article in question is dated as far back
as 1864. We may therefore conclude that the Professor has
not seen much of the subject; nor can he have made himself
acquainted with what others have seen and carefully verified,
or he would hardly have thought his communication worthy
of the place it occupies among original researches and positive
additions to human knowledge. Both its facts and its
reasonings have been well replied to by Mr. Patrick Fraser
Alexander, in his little work entitled “Spiritualism; a Narrative
and a Discussion,” which we recommend to those who
care to see how a very acute yet unprejudiced mind looks at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the phenomena, and how inconclusive, even from a scientific
standpoint, are the experiences adduced by Prof. Tyndall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The discussion in the Pall Mall Gazette in 1868, and a considerable
private correspondence, indicates that scientific men
almost invariably assume that, in this inquiry, they should be
permitted, at the very outset, to impose conditions; and if,
under such conditions, nothing happens, they consider it a
proof of imposture or delusion. But they well know that, in
all other branches of research, Nature, not they, determines
the essential conditions, without a compliance with which no
experiment will succeed. These conditions have to be learnt
by a patient questioning of Nature, and they are different for
each branch of science. How much more may they be expected
to differ in an inquiry which deals with subtle forces
of the nature of which the physicist is wholly and absolutely
ignorant! To ask to be allowed to deal with these unknown
phenomena as he has hitherto dealt with known phenomena,
is practically to prejudge the question, since it assumes that
both are governed by the same laws.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the sketch which has now been given of the recent
treatment of the subject by popular and scientific writers,
we can summarize pretty accurately their mental attitude in
regard to it. They have seen very little of the phenomena
themselves, and they cannot believe that others have seen
much more. They have encountered people who are easily
deceived by a little unexpected trickery, and they conclude
that the convictions of Spiritualists generally are founded on
phenomena produced, either consciously or unconsciously, in
a similar way. They are so firmly convinced, on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i>
grounds, that the more remarkable phenomena said to happen
do not really happen, that they will back their conviction
against the direct testimony of any body of men, preferring
to believe that they are all the victims of some mysterious
delusion whenever imposture is out of the question. To
influence persons in this frame of mind, it is evident that
<em>more</em> personal testimony to isolated facts is utterly useless.
They have, to use the admirable expression of Dr. Carpenter,
“no place in the existing fabric of their thought into which
such facts can be fitted.” It is necessary, therefore, to modify
the “fabric of thought” itself; and it appears to the present
writer that this can best be done by a general historic
sketch of the subject, and by showing, by separate lines of
inquiry, how wide and varied is the evidence, and how remarkably
these lines converge toward one uniform conclusion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The endeavor will be made to indicate, by typical examples
of each class of evidence and without unnecessary
detail, the cumulative force of the argument.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>HISTORICAL SKETCH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Modern Spiritualism dates from March, 1848; it being then
that, for the first time, intelligent communications were held
with the unknown cause of the mysterious knockings and
other sounds, similar to those which had disturbed the Mompesson
and Wesley families in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. This discovery was made by Miss Kate Fox, a
girl of nine years old, and the first recognized example of an
extensive class now known as mediums. It is worthy of remark
that this very first “modern spiritual manifestation”
was subjected to the test of unlimited examination by all the
inhabitants of the village of Hydesville, New York. Though
all were utter skeptics, no one could discover any cause for
the noises, which continued, though with less violence, when
all the children had left the house. Nothing is more common
than the remark that it is absurd and illogical to impute
noises, of which we cannot discover the cause, to the agency
of spirits. So it undoubtedly is when the noises are merely
noises; but is it so illogical when these noises turn out to be
signals, and signals which spell out a fact, which fact, though
wholly unknown to all present, turns out to be true? Yet,
on this very first occasion, twenty-six years ago, the signals
declared that a murdered man was buried in the cellar of the
house; it indicated the exact spot in the cellar under which
the body lay; and upon digging there, at a depth of six
or seven feet, considerable portions of a human skeleton
were found. Yet more: the name of the murdered man
was given, and it was ascertained that such a person had visited
that very house and had disappeared five years before,
and had never been heard of since. The signals further declared
that he, the murdered man, was the signaller; and as
all the witnesses had satisfied themselves that the signals
were not made by any living person or by any assignable
cause, the logical conclusion from the facts was, that it <em>was</em>
the spirit<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of the murdered man; although such a conclusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>might be to some in the highest degree improbable, and to
others in the highest degree absurd.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. It may be as well here to explain that the word “spirit,” which is
often considered to be so objectionable by scientific men, is used throughout
this article (or at all events in the earlier portions of it) merely to avoid
circumlocution, in the sense of the “intelligent cause of the phenomena,”
and not as implying “the spirits of the dead,” unless so expressly stated.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Misses Fox now became involuntary mediums, and the
family (which had removed to the city of Rochester) were
accused of imposture, and offered to submit the children to
examination by a committee of townsmen appointed in public
meeting. Three committees were successively appointed;
the last, composed of violent skeptics who had accused the
previous committees of stupidity or connivance. But all
three, after unlimited investigation, were forced to declare
that the cause of the phenomena was undiscoverable. The
sounds occurred on the wall and floor while the mediums,
after being thoroughly searched by ladies, “stood on pillows,
barefooted, and with their clothes tied round their ankles.”
The last and most skeptical committee reported that, “They
had heard sounds, and failed utterly to discover their origin.
They had proved that neither machinery nor imposture had
been used; and their questions, <em>many of them being mental</em>,
were answered correctly.” When we consider that the mediums
were two children under twelve years of age, and the
examiners utterly skeptical American citizens, thoroughly
resolved to detect imposture, and urged on by excited public
meetings, it may perhaps be considered that even at this early
stage the question of imposture or delusion was pretty well
settled in the negative.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short time persons who sat with the Misses Fox found
themselves to have similar powers in a greater or less degree;
and in two or three years the movement had spread over a
large part of the United States, developing into a variety of
strange forms, encountering the most violent skepticism and
the most rancorous hostility, yet always progressing, and
making converts even among the most enlightened and best
educated classes. In 1851, some of the most intelligent men
in New York—judges, senators, doctors, lawyers, merchants,
clergymen and authors—formed themselves into a society for
investigation. Judge Edmonds was one of these; and a
sketch of the kind and amount of evidence that was required
to convince him will be given further on. In 1854 a second
spiritual society was formed in New York. It had the names
of four judges and two physicians among its Vice-Presidents,
showing that the movement had by this time become respectable,
and that men in high social positions were not afraid of
identifying themselves with it. A little later Professor Mapes,
an eminent agricultural chemist, was led to undertake the investigation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of Spiritualism. He formed a circle of twelve
friends, most of them men of talent, and skeptics, who bound
themselves to sit together weekly, with a medium, twenty
times. For the first eighteen evenings the phenomena were
so trivial and unsatisfactory that most of the party felt disgusted
at the loss of time; but the last two sittings produced
phenomena of so startling a character that the investigation
was continued by the same circle <em>for four years, and all became
Spiritualists</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time the movement had spread into every part of
the Union, and, notwithstanding that its adherents were
abused as impostors or dupes, that they were in several cases
expelled from colleges and churches and were confined as
lunatics, and that the whole thing was “explained” over
and over again—it has continued to spread up to the present
hour. The secret of this appears to have been, that the explanations
given never applied to the phenomena continually
occurring, and of which there were numerous witnesses. A
medium was raised in the air in a crowded room in full daylight.
(“Modern American Spiritualism,” p. 279.) A scientific
skeptic prepared a small portable apparatus, by which
he could produce an instantaneous illumination; and, taking
it to a dark séance at which numerous musical instruments
were played, suddenly lighted up the room while a large
drum was being violently beaten, in the certain expectation
of revealing the impostor to the whole company. But what
they all saw was the drumstick itself beating the drum, with
no human being near it. It struck a few more blows, then
rose into the air and descended gently on to the shoulder of
a lady. (Same work, p. 337.) At Toronto, Canada, in a
well-lighted room, an accompaniment to a song was played
on a closed and locked piano. (Same work, p. 463.) Communications
were given in raised letters on the arm of an ignorant
servant girl, who often could not read them. They
sometimes appeared while she was at her household work,
and after being read by her master or mistress would disappear.
(Same work, p. 196.) Letters closed in any number
of envelopes, sealed up of even pasted together over the
whole of the written surface, were read and answered by
certain mediums in whom this special power was developed.
It mattered not what language the letters were written in;
and it is upon record that letters in German, Greek, Hebrew,
Arabic, Chinese, French, Welsh and Mexican, have been correctly
answered in the corresponding languages by a medium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>who knew none of them. (Judge Edmonds’s “Letters on
Spiritualism,” pp. 59–103, Appendix.) Other mediums drew
portraits of deceased persons whom they had never known
or heard of. Others healed diseases. But those who helped
most to spread the belief were, perhaps, the trance-speakers,
who, in eloquent and powerful language, developed the principles
and the uses of Spiritualism, answered objections,
spread abroad a knowledge of the phenomena, and thus induced
skeptics to inquire into the facts; and inquiry was almost
invariably followed by conversion. Having repeatedly
listened to three of these speakers who have visited this country,
I can bear witness that they fully equal, and not unfrequently
surpass our best orators and preachers; whether in
finished eloquence, in close and logical argument, or in the
readiness with which appropriate and convincing replies are
made to all objectors. They are also remarkable for the perfect
courtesy and suavity of their manner, and for the extreme
patience and gentleness with which they meet the most
violent opposition and the most unjust accusations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men of the highest rank and greatest ability became convinced
by these varied phenomena. No amount of education,
of legal, medical or scientific training, was proof against
the overwhelming force of the facts, whenever these facts
were systematically and perseveringly inquired into. The
number of Spiritualists in the Union is, according to those
who have the best means of judging, from eight to eleven millions.
This is the estimate of Judge Edmonds, who has had
extensive correspondence on the subject with every part of
the United States. The Hon. R. D. Owen, who has also had
great opportunities of knowing the facts, considers it to be
approximately correct; and it is affirmed by the editors of
the “Year-Book of Spiritualism” for 1871. These numbers
have been held to be absurdly exaggerated by persons having
less information, especially by strangers who have made superficial
inquiries in America; but it must be remembered
that the Spiritualists are to a very limited extent an organized
body, and that the mass of them make no public profession
of their belief, but still remain members of some denominational
church—circumstances that would greatly deceive
an outsider. Nevertheless, the organization is of considerable
extent. There were in America, in 1870, 20 State Associations
and 105 Societies of Spiritualists, 207 lecturers, and
about the same number of public mediums.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other parts of the world the movement has progressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>more or less rapidly. Several of the more celebrated American
mediums have visited this country, and not only made
converts in all classes of society, but led to the formation of
private circles and the discovery of mediumistic power in
hundreds of families. There is scarcely a city or a considerable
town in Continental Europe at the present moment
where Spiritualists are not reckoned by hundreds, if not by
thousands. There are said, on good authority, to be fifty
thousand avowed Spiritualists in Paris and ten thousand in
Lyons; and the numbers in England may be roughly estimated
by the fact that there are four exclusively spiritual
periodicals, one of which has a circulation of five thousand
weekly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>DEDUCTIONS FROM THE PRECEDING SKETCH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Before proceeding to a statement of the evidence which has
convinced the more educated and more skeptical converts, let
us consider briefly the bearing of the undoubted fact, that (to
keep within bounds) many thousands of well-informed men,
belonging to all classes of society and all professions, have, in
each of the great civilized nations of the world, acknowledged
the objective reality of these phenomena; although, almost
without exception, they at first viewed them with dislike or
contempt, as impostures or delusions. There is nothing parallel
to it in the history of human thought; because there
never before existed so strong and apparently so well-founded
a conviction that phenomena of this kind never have happened
and never can happen. It is often said, that the number
of adherents to a belief is no proof of its truth. This remark
justly applies to most religions whose arguments appeal
to the emotions and the intellect but not to the evidence of the
senses. It is equally just as applied to a great part of modern
science. The almost universal belief in gravitation, and in
the undulatory theory of light, does not render them in any
degree more probable; because very few indeed of the believers
have tested the facts which most convincingly demonstrate
those theories, or are able to follow out the reasoning by which
they are demonstrated. It is for the most part a blind belief
accepted upon authority. But with these spiritual phenomena
the case is very different. They are to most men so new,
so strange, so incredible, so opposed to their whole habit of
thought, so apparently opposed to the pervading scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>spirit of the age, that they cannot and do not accept them on
second-hand evidence, as they do almost every other kind of
knowledge. The thousands or millions of Spiritualists, therefore,
represent to a very large extent men who have witnessed,
examined, and tested the evidence for themselves, over and
over and over again, till that which they had at first been unable
to admit <em>could</em> be true, they have at last been compelled
to acknowledge <em>is</em> true. This accounts for the utter failure
of all the attempted “exposures” and “explanations” to convince
one solitary believer of his error. The exposers and
explainers have never got beyond those first difficulties which
constitute the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons asinorum</span></i> of Spiritualism, which every believer
has to get over, but at which early stage of investigation
no converts are ever made. By explaining table-turning,
or table-tilting, or raps, you do not influence a man who was
never convinced by these, but who, in broad daylight, sees
objects move without contact, and behave as if guided by intelligent
beings; and who sees this in a variety of forms, in a
variety of places, and under such varied and stringent conditions,
as to make the fact to him just as real as the movement
of iron to the magnet. By explaining automatic writing
(which itself convinces no one but the writer, and not always
even him), you do not affect the belief of the man who has obtained
writing when neither pencil nor paper was touched by
any one; or has seen a hand not attached to any human body
take up a pencil and write; or; as Mr. Andrew Leighton, of
Liverpool, testifies, has seen a pencil rise of itself on a table
and write the words: “<em>And is this world of strife to end in
dust at last?</em>” Thus it is that there are so few recantations or
perverts in Spiritualism; so few, that it may be truly said
there are none. After much inquiry and reading I can find
no example of a man who, having acquired a good personal
knowledge of all the chief phases of the phenomena, has subsequently
come to disbelieve in their reality. If the “explanations”
and “exposures” were good for anything, or if it
were an imposture to expose or a delusion to explain, this
could not be the case, because there are numbers of men who
have become convinced of the facts, but who have not accepted
the spiritual theory. These are, for the most part, in an
uncomfortable and unsettled frame of mind, and would gladly
welcome an explanation which really explained anything—but
they find it not. As an eminent example of this class, I
may mention Dr. J. Lockhart Robertson, long one of the editors
of the Journal of Mental Science—a physician who, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>made mental disease his special study, would not be easily
taken in by any psychological delusions. The phenomena he
witnessed fourteen years ago were of a violent character; a
very strong table being, at his own request and in his own
house, broken to pieces while he held the medium’s hands.
He afterwards himself tried to break a remaining leg of the
table, but failed to do so after exerting all his strength. Another
table was tilted over while all the party sat on it. He
subsequently had a sitting with Mr. Home, and witnessed the
usual phenomena occurring with that extraordinary medium—such
as the accordion playing “most wonderful music without
any human agency,” “a shadow hand, not that of any
one present, which lifts a pencil and writes with it,” &#38;c., &#38;c.;
and he says that he can “no more doubt the physical manifestations
of (so-called) Spiritualism than he would any other
fact—as, for example, the fall of an apple to the ground of
which his senses informed him.” His record of these phenomena,
with the confirmation by a friend who was present,
is published in the “Dialectical Society’s Report on Spiritualism,”
p. 247; and, at a meeting of Spiritualists in 1870, he reasserted
the facts, but denied their spiritual origin. To such
a man the Quarterly Reviewer’s explanations are worthless;
yet it may be safely said, that every advanced Spiritualist has
seen more remarkable, more varied, and even more inexplicable
phenomena than those recorded by Dr. Robertson, and is
therefore still further out of reach of the arguments referred
to, which are indeed only calculated to convince those who
know little or nothing of the matter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>EVIDENCE OF THE FACTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The subject of the evidences of the objective phenomena of
Spiritualism is such a large one that it will be only possible
here to give a few typical examples, calculated to show how
wide is their range, and how conclusively they reach every
objection that the most skeptical have brought against them.
This may perhaps be best done by giving, in the first place,
an outline of the career of two or three well-known mediums;
and, in the second, a sketch of the experiences and investigations
of a few of the more remarkable converts to Spiritualism.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Career of Remarkable Mediums.</em>—Miss Kate Fox, the little
girl of nine years old, who, as already stated, was the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“medium” in the modern sense of the term, has continued
to possess the same power for twenty-six years. At the very
earliest stages of the movement, skeptic after skeptic, committee
after committee endeavored to discover “the trick;”
but if it was a trick this little girl baffled them all, and the
proverbial acuteness of the Yankee was of no avail. In 1860,
when Dr. Robert Chambers visited America, he suggested to
his friend, Robert Dale Owen, the use of a balance to test the
lifting power. They accordingly, without preärrangement
with the medium, took with them a powerful steelyard, and
suspended from it a dining-table weighing one hundred and
twenty-one pounds. Then, under a bright gas-light, the feet
of the two mediums (Miss Fox and her sister) being both
touched by the feet of the gentlemen, and the hands of all
present being held over but not touching the table, it was
made lighter or heavier at request, so as to weigh at one time
only sixty, at another one hundred and thirty-four pounds.
This experiment, be it remembered, was identical with one
proposed by Faraday himself as being conclusive. Mr. Owen
had many sittings with Miss Fox, for the purpose of test, and
the precautions he took were extraordinary. He sat with
her alone; he frequently changed the room without notice; he
examined every article of furniture; he locked the doors and
fastened them with strips of paper privately sealed; he held
both the hands of the medium. Under these conditions various
phenomena occurred, the most remarkable being the illumination
of a piece of paper (which he had brought himself,
cut of a peculiar size, and privately marked,) showing a dark
hand writing on the floor. The paper afterwards rose up on
to the table with legible writing upon it, containing a promise
which was subsequently verified. (“Debatable Land,” p.
293.)</p>

<p class='c007'>But Miss Fox’s powers were most remarkably shown in the
séances with Mr. Livermore, a well-known New York banker,
and an entire skeptic before commencing these experiments.
These sittings were more than three hundred in
number, extending over five years. They took place in four
different houses (Mr. Livermore’s and the medium’s being
both changed during this period), under tests of the most
rigid description. The chief phenomenon was the appearance
of a tangible, visible and audible figure of Mr. Livermore’s
deceased wife, sometimes accompanied by a male
figure, purporting to be Dr. Franklin. The former figure
was often most distinct and absolutely life-like. It moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>various objects in the room. It wrote messages on cards. It
was sometimes formed out of a luminous cloud, and again
vanished before the eyes of the witnesses. It allowed a portion
of its dress to be cut off, which, though at first of strong
and apparently gauzy material texture, yet in a short time melted
away and became invisible. Flowers which melted away
were also given. These phenomena occurred best when Mr.
L. and the medium were alone; but two witnesses were occasionally
admitted, who tested everything and confirmed Mr.
L.’s testimony. One of these was Mr. Livermore’s physician,
the other his brother-in-law; the latter previously a skeptic.
The details of these wonderful séances were published in the
Spiritual Magazine in 1862 and 1863; and the more remarkable
are given in Owen’s “Debatable Land,” from which
work a good idea may be formed of the great variety of the
phenomena that occurred and the stringent character of the
tests employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Fox recently came to England, and here also her powers
have been tested by a competent man of science, and
found to be all that has been stated. She is now married to
an English barrister, and some of the strange phenomena
which have so long accompanied her attach themselves to
her infant child, even when its mother is away, to the great
alarm of the nurse. We have here, therefore, a career of
twenty-six years of mediumship of the most varied and remarkable
character; mediumship which has been scrutinized
and tested from the first hour of its manifestation down to
this day, and with one invariable result—that no imposture
or attempt at imposture has ever been discovered, and no
cause ever been suggested that will account for the phenomena
except that advanced by Spiritualists.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Daniel D. Home is perhaps the best known medium in
the world; and his powers have been open to examination
for at least twenty years. Nineteen years ago Sir David
Brewster and Lord Brougham had a sitting with him—sufficiently
acute and eminent observers, and both, of course
thorough skeptics. In the “Home Life of Sir David Brewster,”
we have, fortunately, his own record of this sitting
made <em>at the time</em>, although six months later, in a letter to the
Morning Advertiser, he made the contradictory statement:
“I saw enough to satisfy myself they could all be produced
by human hands and feet.” He says: “The table actually
rose from the ground when no hand was upon it;” and “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>small hand-bell was laid down with its mouth on the carpet,
and it actually rang when nothing could have touched it.
The bell was then placed on the other side, still upon the carpet,
and it came over to me and placed itself in my hand. It
did the same to Lord Brougham.” And he adds, speaking for
both, “We could give no explanation of them, and could not
conjecture how they could be produced by any kind of
mechanism.” Coming from the author of “Letters on Natural
Magic,” this is pretty good testimony.</p>

<p class='c007'>These and far more marvelous phenomena have been repeated
from that day to this many thousands of times, and
almost always in private houses at which Mr. Home visits.
Everybody testifies to the fact that he offers the most ample
facilities for investigation; and to this I can myself bear witness,
having been invited by him to examine as closely as I
pleased an accordion, held by his one hand, keys downward,
and in that position playing very sweetly. But perhaps the
best-attested and most extraordinary phenomenon connected
with Mr. Home’s mediumship is what is called the fire-test.
In a state of trance he takes a glowing coal from the hottest
part of a bright fire and carries it round the room, so that
every one may see and feel that it is a real one. This is testified
by Mr. H. D. Jencken, Lord Lindsay, Lord Adare, Miss
Douglas, Mr. S. C. Hall, and many others. But, more strange
still, when in this state he can detect the same power in other
persons, or convey it to them. A lump of red-hot coal was
once placed on Mr. S. C. Hall’s head in the presence of Lord
Lindsay and four other persons. Mrs. Hall, in a communication
to the Earl of Dunraven (given in the Spiritual Magazine,
1870, p. 178), says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Hall was seated nearly opposite to where I sat; and
I saw Mr. Home, after standing about half a minute at the
back of Mr. Hall’s chair, deliberately place the lump of burning
coal on his head! I have often wondered that I was not
frightened, but I was not; I had perfect faith that he would
not be injured. Some one said, ‘Is it not hot?’ Mr. Hall
answered, ‘Warm, but not hot!’ Mr. Home had moved a
little way, but returned, still in a trance; he smiled, and
seemed quite pleased, and then proceeded to draw up Mr.
Hall’s white hair over the red coal. The white hair had the
appearance of silver thread over the red coal. Mr. Home
drew the hair into a sort of pyramid, the coal, still red, showing
beneath the hair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When taken off the head—which it had not in the slightest
degree injured or singed the hair—others attempted to touch
it, and were burnt. Lord Lindsay and Miss Douglas have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>also had hot coals placed in their hands, and they describe
them as feeling rather cold than hot; though at the same time
they burn any one else, and even scorch the face of the holder
if approached too closely. The same witnesses also testify
that Mr. Home has placed red-hot coals inside his waistcoat
without scorching his clothes, and has put his face into
the middle of the fire, his hair falling into the flames, yet not
being the least singed. The same power of resisting fire can
be temporarily given to inanimate objects. Mr. H. Nisbet,
of Glasgow, states (“Human Nature,” Feb., 1870) that, in
his own house, in January, 1870, Mr. Home placed a red-hot
coal in the hands of a lady and gentleman, which they only
felt warm; and then placed the same piece on a folded newspaper,
burning a hole through eight layers of paper. He then
took a fresh and blazing coal and laid it on the same newspaper,
carrying it about the room for three minutes, when
the paper was found, this time, not to have been the least
burnt. Lord Lindsay further declares—and as one of the few
noblemen who do real scientific work his evidence must be of
some value—that on eight occasions he has had red-hot coals
placed on his own hand by Home without injury. Mr. W.
H. Harrison (“Spiritualist,” March 15th, 1870) saw him take
a large coal, which covered the palm of his hand, and stood
six or seven inches high. As he walked about the room it
threw a ruddy glow on the walls, and when he came to the
table with it, the heat was felt in the faces of all present.
The coal was thus held for five minutes. These phenomena
have now happened scores of times in the presence of scores
of witnesses. They are facts, of the reality of which there
can be no doubt; and they are altogether inexplicable by the
known laws of physiology and heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The powers of Mr. Home have lately been independently
tested by Serjeant Cox and Mr. Crookes, and both these gentlemen
emphatically proclaim that he invites tests and courts
examination. Serjeant Cox, in his own house, has had a new
accordion (purchased by himself that very day) play by itself,
in his own hand, while Mr. Home was playing the piano.
Mr. Home then took the accordion in his left hand, holding it
with the keys downwards while playing the piano with his
right hand, “and it played beautifully in accompaniment to
the piano, for at least a quarter of an hour.” (“What Am
I?” Vol. II., p. 388.)</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the possibility of these things being produced by
trick, if further evidence than their mere statement be required,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>we have the following by Mr. T. Adolphus Trollope,
who says, “I may also mention that Bosco, one of the greatest
professors of legerdemain ever known, in a conversation
with me upon the subject, utterly scouted the idea of the possibility
of such phenomena as I saw produced by Mr. Home
being performed by any of the resources of his art.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Home’s life has been to a great extent a public one.
He has spent much of his time as a guest in the houses of
people of rank and talent. He numbers among his friends
many who are eminent in science, art, and literature—men
certainly not inferior in perceptive or reasoning power to
those who, not having witnessed the phenomena, disbelieve
in their occurrence. For twenty years he has been exposed
to the keen scrutiny and never-ceasing suspicion of innumerable
inquirers; yet no proof has ever been given of trickery,
no particle of machinery or apparatus ever been detected.
But the phenomena are so stupendous that, if impostures,
they could only be performed by machinery of the most elaborate,
varied and cumbrous nature, requiring the aid of several
assistants and confederates. The theory that they are
delusions is equally untenable, unless it is admitted that there
is no possible means of distinguishing delusion from reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last medium to whose career I shall call attention is
Mrs. Guppy (formerly Miss Nichol), and in this case I can
give some personal testimony. I knew Miss Nichol before
she had ever heard of Spiritualism, table-rapping, or anything
of the kind, and we first discovered her powers on asking her
to sit for experiment in my house. This was in November,
1866, and for some months we had constant sittings, and I
was able to watch and test the progress of her development.
I first satisfied myself of the rising of a small table completely
off the floor, when three or four persons (including Miss
N.) placed their hands on it. I tested this by secretly attaching
threads or thin strips of paper underneath the claws, so
that they must be broken if any one attempted to raise the table
with their feet, the only available means of doing so. The
table still rose a full foot off the floor in broad daylight. In
order to show this to friends with less trouble, I made a cylinder
of hoops and brown paper, in which I placed the table so
as to keep feet and dresses away from it while it rose, which
it did as freely as before. Perhaps more marvelous was the
placing of Miss N. herself on the table; for although this always
happened in the dark, yet, under the conditions to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>named, deception was impossible. I will relate one sitting of
which I have notes. We sat in a friend’s house, round a centre
table, under a glass chandelier. A friend of mine, but a
perfect stranger to all the rest, sat next Miss Nichol and held
both her hands. Another person had matches ready to strike
a light when required. What occurred was as follows: First,
Miss Nichol’s chair was drawn away from under her, and she
was obliged to stand up, my friend still holding both her
hands. In a minute or two more I heard a slight sound, such
as might be produced by a person placing a wine-glass on the
table, and at the same time a very slight rustling of clothes
and tinkling of the glass pendants of the chandelier. Immediately
my friend said, “She is gone from me.” A light was
at once struck, and we found Miss N. quietly seated in her
chair on the centre of the table, her head just touching the
chandelier. My friend declared that Miss N. seemed to glide
noiselessly out of his hands. She was very stout and heavy,
and to get her chair on the table, to get upon it herself, in the
dark, noiselessly, and almost instantaneously, with five or six
persons close around her, appeared, and still appears to me,
knowing her intimately, to be physically impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another very curious and beautiful phenomenon was the
production of delicate musical sounds, without any object calculated
to produce them being in the room. On one occasion
a German lady, who was a perfect stranger to Miss Nichol,
and had never been at a séance before, was present. She
sang several German songs, and most delicate music, like a
fairy musical-box, accompanied her throughout. She sang
four or five different songs of her own choice, and all were so
accompanied. This was in the dark, but hands were joined
all the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most remarkable feature of this lady’s mediumship is
the production of flowers and fruits in closed rooms. The
first time this occurred was at my own house at a very early
stage of her development. All present were my own friends.
Miss Nichol had come early to tea, it being mid-winter, and
she had been with us in a very warm gas-lighted room four
hours before the flowers appeared. The essential fact is, that
upon a bare table in a small room closed and dark (the adjoining
room and passage being well lighted), a quantity of
flowers appeared, which were not there when we put out the
gas a few minutes before. They consisted of anemones, tulips,
chrysanthemums, Chinese primroses, and several ferns.
All were absolutely fresh, as if just gathered from a conservatory.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>They were covered with a fine, cold dew. Not a
petal was crumpled or broken, not the most delicate point or
pinnule of the ferns was out of place. I dried and preserved
the whole, and have, attached to them, the attestation of all
present that they had no share, as far as they knew, in bringing
the flowers into the room. I believed at the time, and
still believe, that it was absolutely impossible for Miss N. to
have concealed them so long, to have kept them so perfect, and,
above all, to produce them covered throughout with a most
beautiful coating of dew, just like that which collects on the
outside of a tumbler when filled with very cold water on a
hot day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Similar phenomena have occurred hundreds of times since,
in many houses and under various conditions. Sometimes
the flowers have been in vast quantities, heaped upon the table.
Often flowers or fruits asked for are brought. A friend
of mine asked for a sunflower, and one six feet high fell upon
the table, having a large mass of earth about its roots. One
of the most striking tests was at Florence, with Mr. T. Adolphus
Trollope, Mrs. Trollope, Miss Blagden, and Colonel
Harvey. The room was searched by the gentlemen; Mrs.
Guppy was undressed and redressed by Mrs. Trollope, every
article of her clothing being examined. Mr. and Mrs. Guppy
were both firmly held while at the table. In about ten minutes
all the party exclaimed that they smelt flowers, and, on
lighting a candle, both Mrs. Guppy’s and Mr. Trollope’s arms
were found covered with jonquils, which filled the room with
their odor. Mr. Guppy and Mr. Trollope both relate this in
substantially the same terms. (“Dialectical Society’s Report
on Spiritualism,” pp. 277 and 372.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely these are phenomena about which there can be no
mistake. What theories have ever been proposed by our scientific
teachers which even attempt to account for them?
Delusion it cannot be, for the flowers are real and can be preserved,
and imposture under the conditions described is even
less credible. If the gentlemen who came forward to enlighten
the public on the subject of “so-called spiritual manifestations”
do not know of the various classes of phenomena that
have now been indicated, and the weight of the testimony in
support of them, they are palpably unqualified for the task
they have undertaken. That they do know of them, but keep
back their knowledge, while putting forward trivialities easy
to laugh at or expose, is a supposition I cannot for a moment
entertain. Before leaving this part of the subject, it is well to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>note the fact of the marked individuality of each medium.
They are not copies of each other, but each one develops a
characteristic set of phenomena—a fact highly suggestive of
some unconscious occult power in the individual, and wholly
opposed to the idea of either imposture or delusion, both of
which almost invariably copy preëxisting models.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Investigations by some Notable Skeptics.</em>—In giving some account
of how a few of the more important converts to Spiritualism
became convinced, we are of course limited to those
who have given their experiences to the public. I will first
take the case of the eminent American lawyer, the Hon. J. W.
Edmonds, commonly called Judge Edmonds; and it may be
as well to let English skeptics know what he is thought of by
his countrymen. When he first became a Spiritualist he was
greatly abused; and it was even declared that he consulted
the spirits on his judicial decisions. To defend himself, he
published an “Appeal to the Public,” giving a full account
of the inquiries which resulted in his conversion. In noticing
this, the New York Evening Mirror said: “John W. Edmonds,
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of this District,
is an able lawyer, an industrious judge and a good citizen.
For the last eight years occupying without interruption
the highest judicial stations, whatever may be his faults no
one can justly accuse him of a lack of ability, industry, honesty
or fearlessness. No one can doubt his general saneness,
or can believe for a moment that the ordinary operations of
his mind are not as rapid, accurate and reliable as ever. Both
by the practitioners and suitors at his bar he is recognized as
the head, in fact and in merit, of the Supreme Court for this
District.” A few years later he published a series of letters
on Spiritualism in the New York Tribune; and in the first of
these he gives a compact summary of his mode of investigation,
from which the following passages are extracted. It
must be remembered that at the time he commenced the inquiry
he was in the prime and vigor of intellectual life, being
fifty-two years of age:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was in January, 1851, that I first began my investigations,
and it was not until April, 1853, that I became a firm
believer in the reality of spiritual intercourse. During twenty-three
months of those twenty-seven, I witnessed several
hundred manifestations in various forms. I kept very minute
and careful records of many of them. My practice was,
whenever I attended a circle, to keep in pencil a memorandum
of all that took place, so far as I could, and, as soon as I
returned home, to write out a full account of what I had witnessed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>I did all this with as much minuteness and particularity
as I had ever kept any record of a trial before me in
court. In this way, during that period, I preserved the record
of nearly two hundred interviews, running through some one
thousand six hundred pages of manuscript. I had these interviews
with many different mediums, and under an infinite
variety of circumstances. No two interviews were alike.
There was always something new, or something different from
what had previously occurred; and it very seldom happened
that only the same persons were present. The manifestations
were of almost every known form, physical or mental; sometimes
only one, and sometimes both combined.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I resorted to every expedient I could devise to detect imposture
and to guard against delusion. I felt in myself, and
saw in others, how exciting was the idea that we were actually
communing with the dead; and I labored to prevent
any undue bias of my judgment. I was at times critical and
captious to an unreasonable extreme; and when my belief
was challenged, as it was over and over again, I refused to
yield, except to evidence that would leave no possible room
for cavil.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was severely exacting in my demands, and this would frequently
happen. I would go to a circle with some doubt on
my mind as to the manifestations at the previous circle, and
something would happen aimed directly at that doubt, and
completely overthrowing it as it then seemed, so that I had
no longer any reason to doubt. But I would go home and
write out carefully my minutes of the evening, cogitate over
them for several days, compare them with previous records,
and finally find some loophole—some possibility that it might
have been something else than spiritual influence, and I would
go to the next circle with a new doubt, and a new set of
queries.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I look back sometimes now, with a smile, at the ingenuity
I wasted in devising ways and means to avoid the possibility
of deception.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a remarkable feature of my investigations that every
conceivable objection I could raise was, first or last, met and
answered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The following extracts are from the “Appeal”:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have seen a mahogany table, having a centre leg, and
with a lamp burning upon it, lifted from the floor at least a
foot, in spite of the efforts of those present, and shaken backward
and forward as one would shake a goblet in his hand,
and the lamp retain its place, though its glass pendants rang
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have known a mahogany chair thrown on its side and
moved swiftly back and forth on the floor, no one touching it,
through a room where there were at least a dozen people sitting,
yet no one was touched; and it was repeatedly stopped
within a few inches of me, when it was coming with a violence
which, if not arrested, must have broken my legs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having satisfied himself of the reality of the physical phenomena,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>he came to the question of whence comes the intelligence
that was so remarkably connected with them. He
says:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Preparatory to meeting a circle, I have sat down alone in
my room, and carefully prepared a series of questions to be
propounded, and I have been surprised to find my questions
answered, and in the precise order in which I wrote them,
without my even taking my memorandum out of my pocket,
and when not a person present knew that I had prepared
questions, much less what they were. My most secret
thoughts, those which I have never uttered to mortal
man or woman, have been freely spoken to as if I had uttered
them; and I have been admonished that my every thought
was known to, and could be disclosed by, the intelligence
which was thus manifesting itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Still the question occurred, ‘May not all this have been,
by some mysterious operation, the mere reflex of the mind of
some one present?’ The answer was, that facts were communicated
which were unknown then, but afterwards found
to be true; like this, for instance: when I was absent last
winter in Central America, my friends in town heard of my
whereabouts and of the state of my health several times; and
on my return, by comparing their information with the entries
in my journal, it was found to be invariably correct.
So thoughts have been uttered on subjects not then in my
mind and utterly at variance with my own notions. This
has often happened to me and to others, so as fully to establish
the fact that it was not our minds that gave forth or affected
the communication.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These few extracts sufficiently show that the writer was
aware of the possible sources of error in such an inquiry;
and the details given in the letters prove that he was constantly
on his guard against them. He himself and his
daughter became mediums; so that he afterwards obtained
personal confirmation of many of the phenomena by himself
alone. But all the phenomena referred to in the letters and
“Appeal” occurred to him in the presence of others, who
testified to them as well, and thus removed the possibility
that the phenomena were subjective.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have yet to add a notice of what will be perhaps, to
many persons, the most startling and convincing of all the
Judge’s experiences. His own daughter became a medium
for speaking foreign languages of which she was totally ignorant.
He says: “She knows no language but her own,
and a little smattering of boarding-school French; yet she
has spoken in nine or ten different tongues, often for an hour
at a time, with the ease and fluency of a native. It is not unfrequent
that foreigners converse with their spirit-friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>through her in their own language.” One of these cases
must be given:</p>

<p class='c009'>“One evening, when some twelve or fifteen persons were
in my parlor, Mr. E. D. Green, an artist of this city, was
shown in, accompanied by a gentleman whom he introduced
as Mr. Evangelides, of Greece. Ere long a spirit spoke to
him through Laura, in English, and said so many things to
him that he identified him as a friend who had died at his
house a few years before, but of whom none of us had ever
heard. Occasionally, through Laura, the spirit would speak
a word or a sentence in Greek, until Mr. E. inquired if he
could be understood if he spoke Greek? The residue of
the conversation for more than an hour was, on his part,
entirely in Greek, and on hers sometimes in Greek and
sometimes in English. At times Laura would not understand
what was the idea conveyed either by her or him.
At other times she would understand him, though he spoke
in Greek, and herself while uttering Greek words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Several other cases are mentioned, and it is stated that this
lady has spoken Spanish, French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese,
Latin, Hungarian and Indian; and other languages which
were unknown to any person present.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is by no means an isolated case, but it is given as being
on most unexceptionable authority. A man must know
whether his own daughter has learnt, so as to speak fluently,
eight languages besides her own, or not. Those who carry
on the conversation must know whether the language is
spoken or not; and in several cases—as the Latin, Spanish,
and Indian—the Judge himself understood the language.
And the phenomenon is connected with Spiritualism by the
speaking being in the name of, and purporting to come from,
some deceased person, and the subject matter being characteristic
of that person. Such a case as this, which has been
published sixteen years, ought to have been noticed and explained
by those who profess to enlighten the public on the
subject of Spiritualism.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our next example is one of the most recent, but at the same
time one of the most useful, converts to the truths of Spiritualism.
Dr. George Sexton, M. D., M. A., L. L. D., was for
many years the coadjutor of Mr. Bradlaugh, and one of the
most earnest and energetic of the secularist teachers. The
celebrated Robert Owen first called his attention to the subject
of Spiritualism about twenty years ago. He read books,
he saw a good deal of the ordinary physical manifestations,
but he always “suspected that the mediums played tricks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and that the whole affair was nothing but clever conjuring
by means of concealed machinery.” He gave several lectures
against Spiritualism in the usual style of non-believers,
dwelling much on the absurdity and triviality of the phenomena,
and ridiculing the idea that they were the work of spirits.
Then came another old friend and fellow-secularist, Mr. Turley,
who, after investigating the subject for the purpose of
exposing it, became a firm believer. Dr. Sexton laughed at
this conversion, yet it made a deep impression on his mind.
Ten years passed away, and his next important investigation
was with the Davenport brothers; and it will be well for
those who sneer at these much-abused young men to take
note of the following account of Dr. Sexton’s proceedings
with them, and especially of the fact that they cheerfully submitted
to every test the doctor suggested. He tells us (in
his lecture, “How I became a Spiritualist,”) that he visited
them again and again, trying in vain to find out the trick.
Then, he says—</p>

<p class='c009'>“My partner—Dr. Barker—and I invited the Brothers to
our houses, and, in order to guard against anything like
trickery, we requested them not to bring any ropes, instruments,
or other apparatus; all these we ourselves had determined
to supply. Moreover, as there were four of them, viz.,
the two Brothers Davenport, Mr. Fay, and Dr. Ferguson,
we suspected that the two who were not tied might really do
all that was done. We therefore requested only two to come.
They unhesitatingly complied with all these requests.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We formed a circle, consisting entirely of members of our
own families and a few private friends, with the one bare
exception of Mrs. Fay. In the circle we all joined hands,
and as Mrs. Fay sat at one end she had one of her hands
free, while I had hold of the other. Thinking that she might
be able to assist with the hand that was thus free, I asked, as
a favor, that I might be allowed to hold both her hands—a
proposition which she at once agreed to. Now, without entering
here at all into what took place, suffice it to say that
we bound the mediums with our own ropes, placed their feet
upon sheets of writing paper, and drew lines around their
boots, so that if they moved their feet it should be impossible
for them to place them again in the same position; we laid
pence on their toes, sealed the ropes, and in every way took
precautions against their moving. On the occasion to which
I now refer, Mr. Bradlaugh and Mr. Charles Watts were present;
and when Mr. Fay’s coat had been taken off, the ropes
still remaining on his hands, Mr. Bradlaugh requested that
his coat might be placed on Mr. Fay, which was immediately
done, the ropes still remaining fastened. We got, on this occasion,
all the phenomena that usually occurred in the presence
of these extraordinary men, particulars of which I shall
probably give on another occasion. Dr. Barker became a believer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>in Spiritualism from the time that the Brothers visited
at his house. I did not see that any proof had been given
that disembodied spirits had any hand in producing the phenomena;
but I was convinced that no tricks had been played,
and that, therefore, these extraordinary physical manifestations
were the result of some occult force in Nature which I
had no means of explaining in the present state of my knowledge.
All the physical phenomena that I had seen now became
clear to me; they were not accomplished by trickery, as
I had formerly supposed, but were the result of some undiscovered
law of Nature, which it was the business of the man
of science to use his utmost endeavors to discover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was maintaining this ground, Spiritualists often
asked him how he explained the intelligence that was manifested;
and he invariably replied that he had not yet seen
proofs of any intelligence other than what might be that of
the medium or of some other persons present in the circle,
adding, that as soon as he did see proofs of such intelligence
he should become a Spiritualist. In this position he stood for
many years, till he naturally believed he should never see
cause to change his opinion. He continued the inquiry, however,
and in 1865 began to hold séances at home; but it was
years before any mental phenomena occurred which were absolutely
conclusive, although they were often of so startling
a nature as would have satisfied any one less skeptical. At
length, after fifteen years of enlightened skepticism—a skepticism
not founded upon ignorance, but which refused to go
one step beyond what the facts so diligently pursued absolutely
demonstrated—the needful evidence came:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The proofs that I did ultimately receive are, many of
them, of a character that I cannot describe minutely to a
public audience, nor indeed have I time to do so. Suffice it
to say, that I got in my own house, in the absence of all mediums
other than those members of my own family and intimate
private friends in whom mediumistic powers became
developed, evidence of an irresistible character that the communications
came from deceased friends and relatives. Intelligence
was again and again displayed which could not
possibly have had any other origin than that which it professed
to have. Facts were named known to no one in the
circle, and left to be verified afterwards. The identity of the
spirits communicating was proved in a hundred different
ways. Our dear departed ones made themselves palpable
both to feeling and to sight; and the doctrine of spirit-communion
was proved beyond the shadow of a doubt. I soon
found myself in the position of Dr. Fenwick in Lord Lytton’s
‘Strange Story.’ ‘Do you believe,’ asked the female attendant
of Margrave, ‘in that which you seek?’ ‘I have
no belief,’ was the answer. ‘True science has none; true
science questions all things, and takes nothing on credit. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>knows but three states of mind—denial, conviction, and the
vast interval between the two, which is not belief, but the
suspension of judgment.’ This describes exactly the phases
through which my mind has passed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Since Dr. Sexton has become a Spiritualist he has been as
energetic an advocate for its truths as he had been before for
the negations of secularism. His experience and ability as a
lecturer, with his long schooling in every form of manifestation,
render him one of the most valuable promulgators of its
teachings. He has also done excellent service in exposing
the pretensions of those conjurers who profess to expose
Spiritualism. This he does in the most practical way, not
only by explaining how the professed imitations of spiritual
manifestations are performed, but by actually performing
them before his audience; and at the same time pointing out
the important differences between what these people do and
what occurs at good séances. Any one who wishes to comprehend
how Dr. Lynn, Messrs. Maskelyne and Cook, and
Herr Dobler perform some of their most curious feats have
only to read his lecture, entitled, “Spirit Mediums and Conjurers,”
before going to witness their entertainments. We
can hardly believe that the man who does this, and who during
fifteen years of observation and experiment held out
against the spiritual theory, is one of those who, as Lord Amberley
tells us, “fall a victim to the most patent frauds, and
are imposed upon by jugglery of the most vulgar order”; or
who, as viewed from Prof. Tyndall’s high scientific standpoint,
are in a frame of mind before which science is utterly
powerless—“dupes beyond the reach of proof, who like to
believe and do not like to be undeceived.” These be brave
words; but we leave our readers to judge whether they come
with a very good grace from men who have the most slender
and inadequate knowledge of the subject they are criticising,
and no knowledge at all of the long-continued and conscientious
investigations of many who are included in their wholesale
animadversions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet one more witness to these marvelous phenomena we
must bring before our readers—a trained and experienced
physicist, who has experimented in his own laboratory, and
has applied tests and measurements of the most rigid and conclusive
character. When Mr. Crookes—the discoverer of the
metal thallium, and a Fellow of the Royal Society—first announced
that he was going to investigate so-called spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>phenomena, many public writers were all approval; for the
complaint had long been that men of science were not permitted
by mediums to inquire too scrupulously into the facts.
One expressed “profound satisfaction that the subject was
about to be investigated by a man so well qualified”; another
was “gratified to learn that the matter is now receiving
the attention of cool and clear headed men of recognized position
in science”; while a third declared that “no one could
doubt Mr. Crookes’s ability to conduct the investigation with
rigid philosophical impartiality.” But these expressions were
evidently insincere, and were only meant to apply in case
the result was in accordance with the writers’ notions of what
it ought to be. Of course, a “scientific investigation” would
explode the whole thing. Had not Faraday exploded table-turning?
They hailed Mr. Crookes as the Daniel come to
judgment—as the prophet who would curse their enemy,
Spiritualism, by detecting imposture and illusion. But when
the judge, after a patient trial lasting several years, decided
against them, and their accepted prophet blessed the hated
thing as an undoubted truth, their tone changed; and they
began to suspect the judge’s ability, and to pick holes in the
evidence on which he founded his judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Mr. Crookes’s latest paper, published in the Quarterly
Journal of Science for January last, we are informed that he
has pursued the inquiry for four years; and besides attending
séances elsewhere, has had the opportunity of making numerous
experiments in his own house with the two remarkable
mediums already referred to, Mr. D. D. Home and Miss
Kate Fox. These experiments were almost exclusively made
in the light, under conditions of his own arranging, and with
his own friends as witnesses. Such phenomena as percussive
sounds; alteration of the weight of bodies; the rising of
heavy bodies in the air without contact by any one; the levitation
of human beings; luminous appearances of various
kinds; the appearance of hands which lift small objects, yet
are not the hands of any one present; direct writing, by a
luminous detached hand or by the pencil alone; phantom
forms and faces; and various mental phenomena—have all
been tested so variously and so repeatedly that Mr. Crookes
is thoroughly satisfied of their objective reality. These phenomena
are given in outline in the paper above referred to,
and they will be detailed in full in a volume now preparing.
I will not, therefore, weary my readers by repeating them
here, but will remark, that these experiments have a weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>as evidence vastly greater than would be due to them as resting
on the testimony of any man of science, however distinguished,
because they are, in almost every case, confirmations
of what previous witnesses in immense numbers have testified
to, in various places, and under various conditions, during
the last twenty years. In every other experimental inquiry,
without exception, confirmation of the facts of an earlier observer
is held to add so greatly to their value, that no one
treats them with the same incredulity with which he might
have received them the first time they were announced. And
when the confirmation has been repeated by three or four independent
observers under favorable conditions, and there is
nothing but theory or negative evidence against them, the
facts are admitted—at least provisionally, and until disproved
by a greater weight of evidence or by discovering the exact
source of the fallacy of preceding observers.</p>

<p class='c007'>But here, a totally different—a most unreasonable and a
most unphilosophical—course is pursued. Each fresh observation,
confirming previous evidence, is treated as though it
were now put forth for the <em>first</em> time; and fresh confirmation
is asked of it. And when this fresh and independent confirmation
comes, yet more confirmation is asked for, and so on
without end. This is a very clever way to ignore and stifle a
new truth; but the facts of Spiritualism are ubiquitous in
their occurrence and of so indisputable a nature, as to compel
conviction in every earnest inquirer. It thus happens that
although every fresh convert requires a large proportion of
the series of demonstrative facts to be reproduced before he
will give his assent to them, the number of such converts has
gone on steadily increasing for a quarter of a century. Clergymen
of all sects, literary men and lawyers, physicians in
large numbers, men of science not a few, secularists, philosophical
skeptics, pure materialists, all have become converts
through the overwhelming logic of the phenomena which
Spiritualism has brought before them. And what have we
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</span></i>? Neither science nor philosophy, neither skepticism
nor religion, has ever yet in this quarter of a century
made one single convert from the ranks of Spiritualism! This
being the case, and fully appreciating the amount of candor
and fairness, and knowledge of the subject, that has been exhibited
by their opponents, is it to be wondered at that a large
proportion of Spiritualists are now profoundly indifferent to
the opinion of men of science, and would not go one step out
of their way to convince them? They say, that the movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>is going on quite fast enough; that it is spreading
by its own inherent force of truth, and slowly permeating all
classes of society. It has thriven in spite of abuse and persecution,
ridicule and argument, and will continue to thrive
whether endorsed by great names or not. Men of science,
like all others, are welcome to enter its ranks; but they must
satisfy themselves by their own persevering researches, not
expect to have its proofs laid before them. Their rejection of its
truths is their own loss, but cannot in the slightest degree affect
the progress of Spiritualism. The attacks and criticisms of
the press are borne good-humoredly, and seldom excite other
feelings than pity for the willful ignorance and contempt for
the overwhelming presumption of their writers. Such are the
sentiments that are continually expressed by Spiritualists;
and it is as well, perhaps, that the outer world, to whom the
literature of the movement is as much unknown as the Vedas,
should be made acquainted with them.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Investigation by the Dialectical Committee.</em>—There are many
other investigators who ought to be noticed in any complete
sketch of the subject, but we have now only space to allude
briefly to the “Report of the Committee of the Dialectical
Society.” Of this committee, consisting of thirty-three acting
members, only eight were, at the commencement, believers
in the reality of the phenomena, while not more than four
accepted the spiritual theory. During the course of the inquiry
at least twelve of the complete skeptics became convinced
of the reality of many of the physical phenomena
through attending the experimental sub-committees, and almost
wholly by means of the mediumship of members of the
committee. At least three members who were previously
skeptics pursued their investigations outside the committee
meetings, and in consequence have become thorough Spiritualists.
My own observation as a member of the committee
and of the largest and most active sub-committee, enables me
to state that the degree of conviction produced in the minds
of the various members was, allowing for marked differences
of character, approximately proportionate to the amount of
time and care bestowed on the investigation. This fact,
which is what occurs in all investigations into these phenomena,
is a characteristic result of the examination into any
natural phenomena. The examination into an imposture or
delusion has, invariably, exactly opposite results: those who
have slender experience being deceived, while those who perseveringly
continue the inquiry inevitably find out the source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of the deception or the delusion. If this were not so, the
discovery of truth and the detection of error would be alike
impossible. The result of this inquiry on the members of
the committee themselves is, therefore, of more importance
than the actual phenomena they witnessed, since these were
far less striking than many of the facts already mentioned.
But they are also of importance as confirming, by a body of
intelligent and unprejudiced men, the results obtained by
previous individual inquirers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving this report, I must call attention to the evidence
it furnishes of the state of opinion among men of education
in France. M. Camille Flammarion, the well-known
astronomer, sent a communication to the committee which
deserves special consideration. Besides declaring his own acceptance
of the objective reality of the phenomena after ten
years of investigation, he makes the following statement:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My learned teacher and friend, M. Babinet, of the Institute,
who has endeavored, with M. E. Liais (now Director of
the Observatory of Brazil), and several others of my colleagues
of the Observatory of Paris, to ascertain their nature
and cause, is not fully convinced of the intervention of
spirits in their production; though this hypothesis, by which
alone certain categories of these phenomena would seem to
be explicable, has been adopted by many of our most esteemed
<em>savants</em>, among others by Dr. Hœffle, the learned author
of the ‘History of Chemistry,’ and the ‘General Encyclopædia’;
and by the diligent laborer in the field of astronomic
discovery whose death we have recently had to deplore,
M. Hermann Goldschmidt, the discoverer of fourteen planets.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It thus appears that in France, as well as in America and
in this country, men of science of no mean rank have investigated
these phenomena and have found them to be realities;
while some of the most eminent hold the spiritual theory to
be the only one that will explain them.</p>

<p class='c007'>This seems the proper place to notice the astounding assertion
of certain writers, that there is not “a particle of evidence”
to support the spiritual theory; that those who accept
it betray “hopeless inability to discriminate between
adequate and inadequate proof of facts”; that the theory is
“formed apart from facts”; and that those who accept it are
so unable to reason as to “jump to the conclusion” that it
must be spirits that move tables, merely because they do not
know how else they can be moved. The preceding account
of how converts to Spiritualism have been made is a sufficient
answer to all this ignorant assertion. The spiritual theory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>as a rule, has only been adopted as a last resource, when all
other theories have hopelessly broken down; and when fact
after fact, phenomenon after phenomenon, has presented
itself, giving direct proof that the so-called dead are still
alive. The spiritual theory is the logical outcome of the
whole of the facts. Those who deny it, in every instance
with which I am acquainted, either from ignorance or disbelief,
leave half the facts out of view. Take the one case
(out of many almost equally conclusive) of Mr. Livermore,
who, during five years, on hundreds of occasions, saw, felt
and heard the movements of the figure of his dead wife in
absolute, unmistakable, living form—a form which could
move objects, and which repeatedly wrote to him in her
own handwriting and her own language, on cards which remained
after the figure had disappeared; a form which was
equally visible and tangible to two friends; which appeared
in his own house, in a room absolutely secured, with
the presence of only a young girl, the medium. Had these
three men “not a particle of evidence” for the spiritual theory?
Is it, in fact, possible to conceive or suggest any more
complete proof? The facts must be got rid of before you can
abolish the theory; and simple denial or disbelief does not
get rid of facts testified during a space of five years by three
witnesses, all men in responsible positions, and carrying on
their affairs during the whole period in a manner to win the
respect and confidence of their fellow-citizens.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. The objection will here inevitably be made: “These wonderful things
always happen in America. When they occur in England it will be time
enough to inquire into them.” Singularly enough, after this article was
in the press the final test was obtained, which demonstrated the occurrence
of similar phenomena in London. A short statement may, therefore,
be interesting for those who cannot digest American evidence. For
some years a young lady, Miss Florence Cook, has exhibited remarkable
mediumship, which latterly culminated in the production of an entire female
form purporting to be spiritual, and which appeared barefooted and
in white flowing robes while she lay entranced, in dark clothing and securely
bound, in a cabinet or adjacent room. Notwithstanding that tests
of an apparently conclusive character were employed, many visitors,
Spiritualists as well as skeptics, got the impression that all was not as it
should be; owing, in part, to the resemblance of the supposed spirit to
Miss Cook, and also to the fact that the two could not be seen at the same
time. Some supposed that Miss C. was an impostor, who managed to conceal
a white robe about her (although she was often searched), and who,
although she was securely tied with tapes and sealed, was able to get out
of her bonds, dress and undress herself, and get into them again, all in
the dark, and in so complete and skillful a manner as to defy detection.
Others thought that the spirit released her, provided her with a white
dress, and sent her forth to personate a ghost. The belief that there was
something wrong led one gentleman—an ardent Spiritualist—to seize the
supposed spirit and endeavor to hold it, in the hope that some other person
would open the cabinet-door and see if Miss Cook was really there. This
was, unfortunately, not done; but the great resemblance of the being he
seized to Miss Cook, its perfect solidity, and the vigorous struggles it
made to escape from him, convinced this gentleman that it was Miss Cook
herself, although the rest of the company, a few minutes afterwards,
found her bound and sealed just as she had been left an hour before. To
determine the question conclusively, experiments have been made within
the last few weeks by two scientific men. Mr. C. F. Varley, F. R. S., the
eminent electrician, made use of a galvanic battery and cable-testing apparatus,
and passed a current through Miss Cook’s body (by fastening
sovereigns soldered to wires to her arms). The apparatus was so delicate
that any movement whatever was instantly indicated, while it was impossible
for the young lady to dress and act as a ghost without breaking
the circuit. Yet under these conditions the spirit-form did appear, exhibited
its arms, spoke, wrote, and touched several persons; and this happened,
be it remembered, not in the medium’s own house, but in that of
a private gentleman in the West End of London. For nearly an hour the
circuit was never broken, and at the conclusion Miss Cook was found in a
deep trance. Since this remarkable experiment Mr. William Crookes,
F.R.S., has obtained, if possible, still more satisfactory evidence. He
contrived a phosphorus lamp, and, armed with this, was allowed to go
into the dark room accompanied by the spirit, and there saw and felt Miss
Cook, dressed in black velvet, lying in a trance on the floor, while the
spirit-form, in white robes, stood close beside her. During the evening
this spirit-form had been for nearly an hour walking and talking with the
company; and Mr. Crookes, by permission, clasped the figure in his arms,
and found it to be, apparently, a real living woman, just as the skeptical
gentleman had done. Yet this figure is not that of Miss Cook, nor of any
other human being, since it appeared and disappeared in Mr. Crookes’s
own house as completely as in that of the medium herself. The full
statements of Messrs. Varley and Crookes, with a mass of interesting detail
on the subject, appeared in the “Spiritualist” newspaper in March
and April last; and they serve to show that whatever marvels occur in
America can be reproduced here, and that men of science are not precluded
from investigating these phenomena with scientific instruments and
by scientific methods. In the concluding part of this paper we shall be
able to show that another class of manifestation which originated in
America—that of the so-called spirit photographs—has been first critically
examined and completely demonstrated in our own country.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We now approach a subject which cannot be omitted in
any impartial sketch of the evidences of Spiritualism, since it
is that which furnishes perhaps the most unassailable demonstration
it is possible to obtain, of the objective reality of spiritual
forms, and also of the truthful nature of the evidence
furnished by seers when they describe figures visible to themselves
alone. It has been already indicated—and it is a fact,
of which the records of Spiritualism furnish ample proof—that
different individuals possess the power of seeing such
forms and figures in very variable degrees. Thus, it often
happens at a séance, that some will see distinct lights of which
they will describe the form, appearance and position, while
others see nothing at all. If only one or two persons see the
lights, the rest will naturally impute it to their imagination;
but there are cases in which only one or two of those present
are unable to see them. There are also cases in which all see
them, but in very different degrees of distinctness; yet that
they see the same objects is proved by their all agreeing as to
the position and the movement of the lights. Again, what
some see as merely luminous clouds, others will see as distinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>human forms, either partial or entire. In other cases all present
see the form—whether hand, face, or entire figure—with
equal distinctness. Again, the objective reality of these appearances
is sometimes proved by their being touched, or by
their being seen to move objects—in some cases heard to speak,
in others seen to write, by several persons at one and the same
time; the figure seen or the writing produced being sometimes
unmistakably recognizable as that of some deceased
friend. A volume could easily be filled with records of this
class of appearances, authenticated by place, date, and names
of witnesses; and a considerable selection is to be found in
the works of Mr. Robert Dale Owen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, at this point, an inquirer, who had not pre-judged the
question, and who did not believe his own knowledge of the
universe to be so complete as to justify him in rejecting all
evidence for facts which he had hitherto considered to be in
the highest degree improbable, might fairly say, “Your evidence
for the appearance of visible, tangible, spiritual forms,
is very strong; but I should like to have them submitted to
a crucial test, which would quite settle the question of the
possibility of their being due to a coincident delusion of several
senses of several persons at the same time; and, if satisfactory,
would demonstrate their objective reality in a way nothing else
can do. If they really reflect or emit light which makes them
visible to human eyes, <em>they can be photographed</em>. Photograph
them, and you will have an unanswerable proof that your human
witnesses are trustworthy.” Two years ago we could only
have replied to this very proper suggestion, that we believed
it had been done and could be again done, but that we had no
satisfactory evidence to offer. Now, however, we are in a
position to state, not only that it has been frequently done,
but that the evidence is of such a nature as to satisfy any one
who will take the trouble carefully to examine it. This evidence
we will now lay before our readers, and we venture to
think they will acknowledge it to be most remarkable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before doing so it may be as well to clear away a popular
misconception. Mr. Lewes advised the Dialectical Committee
to distinguish carefully between “facts and inferences
from facts.” This is especially necessary in the case of what
are called spirit photographs. The figures which occur in
these, when not produced by any human agency, may be of
“spiritual” origin, without being figures “of spirits.” There
is much evidence to show that they are, in some cases, forms
produced by invisible intelligences, but distinct from them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>In other cases the intelligence appears to clothe itself with
matter capable of being perceived by us; but even then it
does not follow that the form produced is the actual image of
the spiritual form. It may be but a reproduction of the
former mortal form with its terrestrial accompaniments, <em>for
purposes of recognition</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most persons have heard of these “ghost-pictures,” and
how easily they can be made to order by any photographer,
and are therefore disposed to think they can be of no use as
evidence. But a little consideration will show them that the
means by which sham ghosts can be manufactured being so
well known to all photographers, it becomes easy to apply
tests or arrange conditions so as to prevent imposition. The
following are some of the more obvious:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. If a person with a knowledge of photography takes his
own glass plates, examines the camera used and all the accessories,
and watches the whole process of taking a picture,
then, if any definite form appears on the negative besides the
sitter, it is a proof that some object was present capable of reflecting
or emitting the actinic rays, although invisible to
those present. 2. If an unmistakable likeness appears of a
deceased person totally unknown to the photographer. 3. If
figures appear on the negative having a definite relation to
the figure of the sitter, who chooses his own position, attitude
and accompaniments, it is a proof that invisible figures were
really there. 4. If a figure appears draped in white, and partly
behind the dark body of the sitter without in the least
showing through, it is a proof that the white figure was there
at the same time, because the dark parts of the negative are
transparent, and any white picture in any way superposed
would show through. 5. Even should none of these tests be
applied, yet if a medium, quite independent of the photographer,
sees and describes a figure during the sitting and an exactly
corresponding figure appears on the plate, it is a proof
that such a figure was there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one of these tests have now been successfully applied
in our own country, as the following outline of the facts
will show:</p>

<p class='c007'>The accounts of spirit-photography in several parts of the
United States caused many Spiritualists in this country to
make experiments; but for a long time without success. Mr.
and Mrs. Guppy, who are both amateur photographers, tried
at their own house, and failed. In March, 1872, they went
one day to Mr. Hudson’s, a photographer living near them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>(not a Spiritualist), to get some <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cartes de visite</span></i> of Mrs. Guppy.
After the sitting the idea suddenly struck Mr. Guppy that he
would try for a spirit-photograph. He sat down, told Mrs.
G. to go behind the background, and had a picture taken.
There came out behind him a large, indefinite, oval white
patch, somewhat resembling the outline of a draped figure.
Mrs. Guppy, behind the background, was dressed in black.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the first spirit-photograph taken in England, and it’s
perhaps more satisfactory on account of the suddenness of
the impulse under which it was taken, and the great white
patch which no impostor would have attempted to produce,
and which, taken by itself, utterly spoils the picture. A few
days afterwards, Mr. and Mrs. Guppy and their little boy
went without any notice. Mrs. Guppy sat on the ground
holding the boy on a stool. Her husband stood behind looking
on. The picture thus produced is most remarkable. A
tall female figure, finely draped in white, gauzy robes, stands
directly behind and above the sitters, looking down on them
and holding its open hands over their heads, as if giving a
benediction. The face is somewhat Eastern, and, with the
hands, is beautifully defined. The white robes pass behind
the sitters’ dark figures without in the least showing through.
A second picture was then taken as soon as a plate could be
prepared; and it was fortunate it was so, for it resulted in a
most remarkable test. Mrs. Guppy again knelt with the boy;
but this time she did not stoop so much, and her head was
higher. The same white figure comes out equally well defined,
but <em>it has changed its position in a manner exactly corresponding
to the slight change of Mrs. Guppy’s position</em>. The
hands were before on a level; now one is raised considerably
higher than the other, so as to keep it about the same distance
from Mrs. Guppy’s head as it was before. The folds of the
drapery all correspondingly differ, and the head is slightly
turned. Here, then, one of two things is absolutely certain.
Either there was a living, intelligent, but invisible being
present, or Mr. and Mrs. Guppy, the photographer, and some
fourth person, planned a wicked imposture, and have maintained
it ever since. Knowing Mr. and Mrs. Guppy so well
as I do, I feel an absolute conviction that they are as incapable
of an imposture of this kind as any earnest inquirer after
truth in the department of natural science.</p>

<p class='c007'>The report of these pictures soon spread. Spiritualists in
great numbers came to try for similar results, with varying
degrees of success; till after a time rumor of imposture arose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>and it is now firmly believed by many, from suspicious appearances
on the pictures and from other circumstances, that a
large number of shams have been produced. It is certainly
not to be wondered at if it be so. The photographer, remember,
was not a Spiritualist, and was utterly puzzled at the
pictures above described. Scores of persons came to him,
and he saw that they were satisfied if they got a second figure
with themselves, and dissatisfied if they did not. He <em>may</em>
have made arrangements by which to satisfy everybody. One
thing is clear: that if there has been imposture, it was at
once detected by Spiritualists themselves; if not, then Spiritualists
have been quick in noticing what appeared to indicate
it. Those, however, who most strongly assert imposture,
allow that a large number of genuine pictures have been
taken. But, true or not, the cry of imposture did good, since
it showed the necessity for tests and for independent confirmation
of the facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The test of clearly recognizable likenesses of deceased
friends has often been obtained. Mr. William Howitt, who
went without previous notice, obtained likenesses of two
sons, many years dead, and of the very existence of one of
which even the friend who accompanied Mr. Howitt was ignorant.
The likenesses were instantly recognized by Mrs.
Howitt; and Mr. Howitt declares them to be “perfect and
unmistakable.” (Spiritual Magazine, Oct., 1872.) Dr. Thomson,
of Clifton, obtained a photograph of himself, accompanied
by that of a lady he did not know. He sent it to his
uncle in Scotland, simply asking if he recognized a resemblance
to any of the family deceased. The reply was that it
was the likeness of Dr. Thomson’s own mother, who died at
his birth; and there being no picture of her in existence, he
had no idea what she was like. The uncle very naturally remarked,
that he “could not understand how it was done.”
(Spiritual Magazine, Oct., 1873.) Many other instances of
recognition have occurred, but I will only add my personal
testimony. A few weeks back I myself went to the same
photographer’s for the first time, and obtained a most unmistakable
likeness of a deceased relative. We will now pass to
a better class of evidence, the private experiments of amateurs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Thomas Slater, an old-established optician in the Euston
Road, and an amateur photographer, took with him to
Mr. Hudson’s a new camera of his own manufacture and his
own glasses, saw everything done, and obtained a portrait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>with a second figure on it. He then began experimenting in
his own private house, and during last summer obtained some
remarkable results. The first of his successes contains two
heads by the side of a portrait of his sister. One of these
heads is unmistakably the late Lord Brougham’s; the other,
much less distinct, is recognized by Mr. Slater as that of Robert
Owen, whom he knew intimately up to the time of his
death. He has since obtained several excellent pictures of
the same class. One in particular shows a female in black
and white flowing robes, standing by the side of Mr. Slater.
In another the head and bust appears, leaning over his shoulder.
The faces of these two are much alike, and other members
of the family recognize them as likenesses of Mr. Slater’s
mother, who died when he was an infant. In another a
pretty child-figure, also draped, stands beside Mr. Slater’s
little boy. Now, whether these figures are correctly identified
or not, is not the essential point. The fact that <em>any</em> figures,
so clear and unmistakably human in appearance as
these, should appear on plates taken in his own private studio
by an experienced optician and amateur photographer, who
makes all his apparatus himself, and with no one present but
the members of his own family, is the real marvel. In one
case a second figure appeared on a plate with himself, taken
by Mr. Slater when he was absolutely alone—by the simple
process of occupying the sitter’s chair after uncapping the
camera. He and his family being themselves mediums, they
require no extraneous assistance; and this may perhaps be
the reason why he has succeeded so well. One of the most
extraordinary pictures obtained by Mr. Slater is a full-length
portrait of his sister, in which there is no second figure, but
the sitter appears covered all over with a kind of transparent
lace drapery, which on examination is seen to be wholly made
up of shaded circles of different sizes, quite unlike any material
fabric I have seen or heard of.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Slater has himself shown me all these pictures and
explained the conditions under which they were produced.
That they are not impostures is certain; and as the first independent
confirmations of what had been previously obtained
only through professional photographers, their value is inestimable.</p>

<p class='c007'>A less successful but not perhaps on that account less satisfactory
confirmation has been obtained by another amateur,
who, after eighteen months of experiment, obtained a partial
success. Mr. R. Williams, M. A., Ph. D., of Hayward’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Heath, succeeded last summer in obtaining three photographs,
each with part of a human form besides the sitter, one
having the features distinctly marked. Subsequently another
was obtained, with a well-formed figure of a man standing
at the side of the sitter, but while being developed, this figure
faded away entirely. Mr. Williams assures me (in a letter)
that in these experiments there was “no room for trick
or for the production of these figures by any known means.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The editor of the British Journal of Photography has made
experiments at Mr. Hudson’s studio, taking his own collodion
and new plates, and doing everything himself, yet there were
“abnormal appearances” on the pictures, although no distinct
figures.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to the valuable and conclusive experiments
of Mr. John Beattie, of Clifton, a retired photographer of
twenty years’ experience, and of whom the above-mentioned
editor says: “Every one who knows Mr. Beattie will give
him credit for being a thoughtful, skillful, and intelligent
photographer, one of the last men in the world to be easily
deceived, at least in matters relating to photography, and one
quite incapable of deceiving others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Beattie has been assisted in his researches by Dr. Thomson,
an Edinburgh M. D., who has practiced photography, as
an amateur, for twenty-five years. They experimented at
the studio of a friend, who was not a Spiritualist (but who
became a medium during the experiments), and had the services
of a tradesman—with whom they were well acquainted—as
a medium. The whole of the photographic work was
done by Messrs. Beattie and Thomson, the other two sitting
at a small table. The pictures were taken in series of three,
within a few seconds of each other, and several of these series
were taken at each sitting. The figures produced are,
for the most part, not human, but variously-formed and shaded
white patches, which in successive pictures change their
form, and develop, as it were, into a more perfect or complete
type. Thus, one set of five begins with two white somewhat
angular patches over the middle sitter, and ends with a rude
but unmistakable white female figure, covering the larger part
of the plate. The other three show intermediate states, indicating
a continuous change of form from the first figure to
the last. Another set (of four pictures) begins with a white
vertical cylinder over the body of the medium, and a shorter
one on his head. These change their form in the second and
third, and in the last become laterally spread out into luminous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>masses resembling nebulæ. Another set of three is very
curious. The first has an oblique flowing luminous patch
from the table to the ground; in the second, this has changed
to a white serpentine column, ending in a point above the medium’s
head; in the third, the column has become broader
and somewhat double, with the curve in an opposite direction,
and with a head-like termination. The change of the
curvature may have some connection with a change in the position
of the sitters, which is seen to have taken place between
the second and the third of this set. There are two
others, taken, like all the preceding, in 1872, but which the
medium described during the exposure. The first, he said,
was a thick white fog; and the picture came out all shaded
white, with not a trace of any of the sitters. The other was
described as a fog with a figure standing in it; and here a
white human figure is alone seen in the almost uniform foggy
surface. During the experiments made in 1873, the medium,
<em>in every case</em>, minutely and correctly described the appearances
which afterwards came out on the plate. In one there
is a luminous-rayed star of large size, with a human face
faintly visible in the centre. This is the last of three in
which the star developed, and the whole were accurately described
by the medium. In another set of three, the medium
first described “a light behind him, coming from the floor.”
The next, “a light rising over another person’s arms, coming
from his own boot.” The third, “there is the same light,
but now a column comes up through the table, and it is hot to
my hands.” Then he suddenly exclaimed, “What a bright
light up there! Can you not see it?” pointing to it with his
hand. All this most accurately describes the three pictures,
and in the last, the medium’s hand is seen pointing to a white
patch which appears overhead. There are other curious developments,
the nature of which is already sufficiently indicated;
but one very startling single picture must be mentioned.
During the exposure one medium said he saw on the
background a black figure, the other medium saw a light figure
by the side of the black one. In the picture both these
figures appear, the light one very faintly, the black one much
more distinctly, of a gigantic size, with a massive coarse-featured
face and long hair.—(<cite>Spiritual Magazine, January
and August, 1873</cite>; <cite>Photographic News, June 28th, 1872</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Beattie has been so good as to send me for examination
a complete set of these most extraordinary photographs, thirty-two
in number, and has furnished me with any particulars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>I desired. I have described them as correctly as I am able;
and Dr. Thomson has authorized me to use his name as confirming
Mr. Beattie’s account of the conditions under which
they appeared. These experiments were not made without
labor and perseverance. Sometimes twenty consecutive pictures
produced absolutely nothing unusual. Hundreds have
been taken, and more than half have been complete failures.
But the successes have been well worth the labor. They
demonstrate the fact that what a medium or sensitive sees
(even where no one else sees anything) may often have an
objective existence. They teach us that perhaps the bookseller,
Nicolai, of Berlin—whose case has been quoted <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad nauseam</span></i>
as the type of a “spectral illusion”—saw real beings
after all; and that, had photography been then discovered
and properly applied, we might now have the portraits of the
invisible men and women who crowded his room. They give
us hints of a process by which the figures seen at séances may
have to be gradually formed or developed, and enable us better
to understand the statements repeatedly made by the
communicating intelligences, that it is very difficult to produce
definite, visible and tangible forms, and that it can only
be done under a rare combination of favorable conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>We find, then, that three amateur photographers, working
independently in different parts of England, separately confirm
the fact of spirit-photography—already demonstrated to
the satisfaction of many who had tested it through professional
photographers. The experiments of Mr. Beattie and Dr.
Thomson are alone absolutely conclusive; and, taken in connection
with those of Mr. Slater and Dr. Williams, and the
test photographs, like those of Mrs. Guppy, establish as a
scientific fact the objective existence of invisible human
forms and definite invisible actinic images. Before leaving
the photographic phenomena we have to notice two curious
points in connection with them. The actinic action of the
spirit-forms is peculiar, and much more rapid than that of
the light reflected from ordinary material forms; for the
figures start out the moment the developing fluid touches
them, while the figure of the sitter appears much later. Mr.
Beattie noticed this throughout his experiments, and I was
myself much struck with it when watching the development
of three pictures recently taken at Mr. Hudson’s. The second
figure, though by no means bright, always came out long
before any other part of the picture. The other singular
thing is, the copious drapery in which these forms are almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>always enveloped, so as to show only just what is necessary
for recognition of the face and figure. The explanation
given of this is, that the human form is more difficult to materialize
than drapery. The conventional “white-sheeted
ghost” was not then all fancy, but had a foundation in fact—a
fact, too, of deep significance, dependent on the laws of a
yet unknown chemistry.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>SUMMARY OF THE MORE IMPORTANT MANIFESTATIONS, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As we have not been able to give an account of many curious
facts which occur with the various classes of mediums,
the following catalogue of the more important and well-characterized
phenomena may be useful. They may be grouped
provisionally, as, Physical, or those in which material objects
are acted on, or apparently material bodies produced; and
Mental, or those which consist in the exhibition, by the medium,
of powers or faculties not possessed in the normal state.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal physical phenomena are the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Simple Physical Phenomena.</em>—Producing sounds of all
kinds, from a delicate tick to blows like those of a heavy
sledge-hammer. Altering the weight of bodies. Moving
bodies without human agency. Raising bodies into the air.
Conveying bodies to a distance out of and into closed rooms.
Releasing mediums from every description of bonds, even
from welded iron rings, as has happened in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Chemical.</em>—Preserving from the effects of fire, as already
detailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Direct Writing and Drawing.</em>—Producing writing or
drawing on marked papers, placed in such positions that no
human hand (or foot) can touch them. Sometimes, visibly
to the spectators, a pencil rising up and writing or drawing
apparently by itself. Some of the drawings in many colors
have been produced on marked paper in from ten to twenty
seconds, and the colors found wet. (See Mr. Coleman’s evidence
in “Dialectical Report,” p. 143, confirmed by Lord
Borthwick, p. 150.) Mr. Thomas Slater, of 136 Euston Road,
is now obtaining communication in the following manner: A
bit of slate pencil an eighth of an inch long is laid on a table;
a clean slate is laid over this, in a well-lighted room; the
sound of writing is then heard, and in a few minutes a communication
of considerable length is found distinctly written.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>At other times the slate is held between himself and another
person, their other hands being joined. Some of these communications
are philosophical discussions on the nature of
spirit and matter, supporting the usual Spiritual theory on
this subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Musical Phenomena.</em>—Musical instruments, of various
kinds, played without human agency, from a hand-bell to a
closed piano. With some mediums, and where the conditions
are favorable, original musical compositions of a very high
character are produced. This occurs with Mr. Home.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Spiritual Forms.</em>—These are either luminous appearances,
sparks, stars, globes of light, luminous clouds, &#38;c.; or,
hands, faces, or entire human figures, usually covered with
flowing drapery, except a portion of the face and hands. The
human forms are often capable of moving solid objects, and
are both visible and tangible to all present. In other cases they
are only visible to seers, but when this is the case it sometimes
happens that the seer describes the figure as lifting a
flower or a pen, and others present see the flower or the pen
apparently move by itself. In some cases they speak distinctly;
in others the voice is heard by all, the form only
seen by the medium. The flowing robes of these forms have
in some cases been examined, and pieces cut off, which have
in a short time melted away. Flowers are also brought, some
of which fade away and vanish; others are real, and can be
kept indefinitely. It must not be concluded that any of these
forms are actual spirits; they are probably only temporary
forms produced by spirits for purposes of test, or of recognition
by their friends. This is the account invariably given of
them by communications obtained in various ways; so that
the objection once thought to be so crushing—that there can
be no “ghosts” of clothes, armor, or walking-sticks—ceases
to have any weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. <em>Spiritual Photographs.</em>—These, as just detailed, demonstrate
by a purely physical experiment the trustworthiness of
the preceding class of observations.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to the mental phenomena, of which the following
are the chief:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Automatic Writing.</em>—The medium writes involuntarily;
often matter which he is not thinking about, does not expect,
and does not like. Occasionally definite and correct information
is given of facts of which the medium has not, nor ever
had, any knowledge. Sometimes future events are accurately
predicted. The writing takes place either by the hand or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>through a planchette. Often the handwriting changes. Sometimes
it is written backwards; sometimes in languages the
medium does not understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Seeing, or Clairvoyance and Clairaudience.</em>—This is of
various kinds. Some mediums see the forms of deceased persons
unknown to them, and describe their peculiarities so
minutely that their friends at once recognize them. They
often hear voices, through which they obtain names, date,
and place, connected with the individuals so described. Others
read sealed letters in any language, and write appropriate
answers.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Trance-Speaking.</em>—The medium goes into a more or less
unconscious state, and then speaks, often on matters and in a
style far beyond his own capacities. Thus, Serjeant Cox—no
mean judge on a matter of literary style—says, “I have
heard an uneducated bar-man, when in a state of trance,
maintain a dialogue with a party of philosophers on ‘Reason
and Foreknowledge, Will and Fate,’ and hold his own against
them. I have put to him the most difficult questions in psychology,
and received answers, always thoughtful, often full
of wisdom, and invariably conveyed in choice and elegant
language. Nevertheless a quarter of an hour afterwards,
when released from the trance, he was unable to answer the
simplest query on a philosophical subject, and was even at a
loss for sufficient language to express a commonplace idea,”
(“What am I?” Vol. II., p. 242.) That this is not overstated
I can myself testify, from repeated observation of the same
medium. And from other trance-speakers—such as Mrs.
Hardinge, Mrs. Tappan, and Mr. Peebles—I have heard
discourses which, for high and sustained eloquence, noble
thoughts, and high moral purpose, surpassed the best efforts
of any preacher or lecturer within my experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Impersonation.</em>—This occurs during trance. The medium
seems taken possession of by another being; speaks, looks
and acts the character in a most marvelous manner; in some
cases speaks foreign languages never even heard in the normal
state; as in the case of Miss Edmonds, already given.
When the influence is violent or painful, the effects are such
as have been in all ages imputed to possession by evil spirits.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Healing.</em>—There are various forms of this. Sometimes
by mere laying on of hands, an exalted form of simple mesmeric
healing. Sometimes, in the trance state, the medium at
once discovers the hidden malady, and prescribes for it, often
describing very exactly the morbid appearance of internal
organs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The purely mental phenomena are generally of no use as
evidence to non-Spiritualists, except in those few cases where
rigid tests can be applied; but they are so intimately connected
with the physical series, and often so interwoven with
them, that no one who has sufficient experience to satisfy him
of the reality of the former, fails to see that the latter form
part of the general system, and are dependent on the same
agencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the physical series the case is very different. They
form a connected body of evidence, from the simplest to the
most complex and astounding, every single component fact
of which can be and has been repeatedly demonstrated by
itself; while each gives weight and confirmation to all the
rest. They have all, or nearly all, been before the world for
twenty years; the theories and explanations of reviewers and
critics do not touch them, or in any way satisfy any sane man
who has repeatedly witnessed them; they have been tested
and examined by skeptics of every grade of incredulity, men
in every way qualified to detect imposture or to discover natural
causes—trained physicists, medical men, lawyers and
men of business—but in every case the investigators have
either retired baffled, or become converts.</p>

<p class='c007'>There have, it is true, been some impostors who have attempted
to imitate the phenomena; but such cases are few in
number, and have been discovered by tests far less severe
than those to which the genuine phenomena have been submitted
over and over again; and a large proportion of these
phenomena have never been imitated, because they are beyond
successful imitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now what do our leaders of public opinion say, when a scientific
man of proved ability again observes a large portion
of the more extraordinary phenomena, in his own house, under
test conditions, and affirms their objective reality; and
this not after a hasty examination, but after four years of research?
Men “with heavy scientific appendages to their
names” refuse to examine them when invited; the eminent
society of which he is a fellow refuses to record them; and
the press cries out that it wants better witnesses than Mr.
Crookes, and that such facts want “confirmation” before
they can be believed. But why more confirmation? And
when again “confirmed,” who is to confirm the confirmer?
After the whole range of the phenomena had been before the
world ten years, and had convinced skeptics by tens of thousands—skeptics,
be it remembered, of common sense and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>than common acuteness, Americans of all classes—they were
<em>confirmed</em> by the first chemist in America, Professor Robert
Hare. Two years later they were again confirmed by the
elaborate and persevering inquiries of one of the first American
lawyers, Judge Edmonds. Then by another good chemist,
Professor Mapes. In France the truth of the simpler
physical phenomena was <em>confirmed</em> by Count A. de Gasparin,
in 1854; and since then French astronomers, mathematicians
and chemists of high rank have <em>confirmed</em> them. Professor
Thury of Geneva again <em>confirmed</em> them, in 1855. In our own
country such men as Professor de Morgan, Dr. Lockhart Robertson,
T. Adolphus Trollope, Dr. Robert Chambers, Serjeant
Cox, Mr. C. F. Yarley, as well as the skeptical Dialectical
Committee, have independently <em>confirmed</em> large portions of
them; and lastly comes Mr. William Crookes, F.R.S., with
four years of research and unrestricted experiment with the
two oldest and most remarkable mediums in the world, and
again <em>confirms</em> almost the whole series! But even this is not
all. Through an independent set of most competent observers
we have the crucial test of photography; a witness which
cannot be deceived, which has no preconceived opinions,
which cannot register “subjective” impressions; a thoroughly
scientific witness, who is admitted into our law courts, and
whose testimony is good as against any number of recollections
of what did happen or opinions as to what ought to and
must have happened. And what have the other side brought
against this overwhelming array of consistent and unimpeachable
evidence? They have merely made absurd and inadequate
suppositions, but have not disproved or explained
away one weighty fact!</p>

<p class='c007'>My position, therefore, is, that the phenomena of Spiritualism
in their entirety do <em>not</em> require further confirmation.
They are proved quite as well as any facts are proved in
other sciences; and it is not denial or quibbling that can
disprove any of them, but only fresh facts and accurate deductions
from those facts. When the opponents of Spiritualism
can give a record of their researches approaching in duration
and completeness to those of its advocates; and when
they can discover and show in detail, either how the phenomena
are produced or how the many sane and able men here
referred to have been deluded into a coincident belief that
they have witnessed them: and when they can prove the correctness
of their theory by producing a like belief in a body
of equally sane and able unbelievers—then, and not till then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>will it be necessary for Spiritualists to produce fresh confirmation
of facts which are, and always have been, sufficiently
real and indisputable to satisfy any honest and persevering
inquirer.</p>

<p class='c007'>This being the state of the case as regards evidence and
proof, we are fully justified in taking the <em>facts</em> of Modern
Spiritualism (and with them the spiritual theory as the only
tenable one) as being fully established. It only remains to
give a brief account of the more important uses and teachings
of Spiritualism.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>HISTORICAL TEACHINGS OF SPIRITUALISM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The lessons which Modern Spiritualism teaches may be
classed under two heads. In the first place, we find that it
gives a rational account of various phenomena in human history
which physical science has been unable to explain, and
has therefore rejected or ignored; and, in the second, we derive
from it some definite information as to man’s nature and destiny,
and, founded on this, an ethical system of great practical
efficacy. The following are some of the more important phenomena
of history and of human nature which science cannot
deal with, but which Spiritualism explains:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. It is no small thing that the Spiritualist finds himself
able to rehabilitate Socrates as a sane man, and his “demon”
as an intelligent spiritual being who accompanied him through
life—in other words, a guardian spirit. The non-Spiritualist
is obliged to look upon one of the greatest men in human history,
not only as subject all his life to a mental illusion, but
as being so weak, foolish, or superstitious as never to discover
that it was an illusion. He is obliged to disbelieve the fact
asserted by contemporaries and by Socrates himself, that it
forewarned him truly of dangers; and to hold that this noble
man, this subtle reasoner, this religious skeptic, who was
looked up to with veneration and love by the great men who
were his pupils, was imposed upon by his own fancies, and
never during a long life found out that they were fancies, and
that their supposed monitions were as often wrong as right.
It is a positive mental relief not to have to think thus of Socrates.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Spiritualism allows us to believe that the oracles of antiquity
were not all impostures; that a whole people, perhaps
the most intellectually acute who ever existed, were not all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>dupes. In discussing the question, “Why the Prophetess
Pythia giveth no Answers now from the Oracle in Verse,”
Plutarch tells us that when kings and states consulted the
oracle on weighty matters that might do harm if made public,
the replies were couched in enigmatical language; but when
private persons asked about their own affairs they got direct
answers in the plainest terms, so that some people even complained
of their simplicity and directness, as being unworthy
of a divine origin. And he adds this positive testimony:
“Her answers, though submitted to the severest scrutiny,
have never proved false or incorrect. On the contrary, the
verification of them has filled the temple with gifts from all
parts of Greece and foreign countries.” And again, “The
answer of Pythoness proceeds to the very truth, without any
diversion, circuit, fraud, or ambiguity. It has never yet, in
a single instance, been convicted of falsehood.” Would such
statements be made by such a writer, if these oracles were all
the mere guesses of impostors? The fact that they declined
and ultimately failed, is wholly in their favor: for why should
imposture cease as the world became less enlightened and
more superstitious? Neither does the fact that the priests
could sometimes be bribed to give out false oracles prove anything,
against such statements as that of Plutarch and the belief
during many generations, supported by ever-recurring
experiences, of the greatest men of antiquity. That belief
could only have been formed by demonstrative facts; and
Modern Spiritualism enables us to understand the nature of
those facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Both the Old and New Testaments are full of Spiritualism,
and Spiritualists alone can read the record with an enlightened
belief. The hand that wrote upon the wall at Belshazzar’s
feast, and the three men unhurt in Nebuchadnezzar’s
fiery furnace, are for them actual facts which they need
not explain away. St. Paul’s language about “spiritual
gifts,” and “trying the spirits,” is to them intelligible language,
and the “gift of tongues” a simple fact. When Christ
cast out “devils” or evil spirits, he really did so—not merely
startle a madman into momentary quiescence; and the water
changed into wine, as well as the bread and fishes continually
renewed till five thousand men were fed, are credible as extreme
manifestations of a power which is still daily at work
among us.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The miracles of the saints, when well attested, come
into the same category. Those of St. Bernard, for instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>were often performed in broad day before thousands of spectators,
and were recorded by eye-witnesses. He was himself
greatly troubled by them, wondering why this power was bestowed
upon him, and fearing lest it should make him less
humble. This was not the frame of mind, nor was St. Bernard’s
the character, of a deluded enthusiast. The Spiritualist
need not believe that all this never happened; or that St.
Francis d’Assisi and St. Theresa were not raised into the air,
as eye-witnesses declared they were.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Witchcraft and witchcraft trials have a new interest for
the Spiritualist. He is able to detect hundreds of curious and
minute coincidences with phenomena he has himself witnessed;
he is able to separate the <em>facts</em> from the absurd <em>inferences</em>
which people imbued with the frightful superstition of diabolism
drew from them, and from which false inferences all the
horrors of the witchcraft mania arose. Spiritualism, and
Spiritualism alone, gives a rational explanation of witchcraft,
and determines how much of it was objective fact, how much
subjective illusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Modern Roman Catholic miracles become intelligible
facts. Spirits whose affections and passions are strongly excited
in favor of Catholicism, produce those appearances of the
Virgin and of saints which they know will tend to increased
religious fervor. The appearance itself may be an objective
reality; while it is only an inference that it is the Virgin Mary—an
inference which every intelligent Spiritualist would repudiate
as in the highest degree improbable.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Second-sight, and many of the so-called superstitions of
savages, may be realities. It is well known that mediumistic
power is more frequent and more energetic in mountainous
countries; and as these are generally inhabited by
the less civilized races, the beliefs that are more prevalent
there may be due to facts which are more prevalent, and be
wrongly imputed to the coincident ignorance. It is known
to Spiritualists that the pure dry air of California led to more
powerful and more startling manifestations than in any other
part of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The recently-discussed question of the efficacy of prayer
receives a perfect solution by Spiritualism. Prayer may
be often answered, though not directly, by the Deity. Nor
does the answer depend wholly on the morality or the religion
of the petitioner; but as men who are both moral and religious,
and are firm believers in a divine response to prayer,
will pray more frequently, more earnestly and more disinterestedly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>they will attract toward them a number of spiritual
beings who sympathize with them, and who, when the necessary
mediumistic power is present, will be able, as they are
often willing, to answer the prayer. A striking case is that of
George Müller, of Bristol, who has now for forty-four years
depended wholly for his own support, and that of his wonderful
charities, on answer to prayer. His “Narrative of
Some of the Lord’s Dealings with George Müller” (6th Ed.,
1860), should have been referred to in the late discussion,
since it furnishes a better demonstration that prayer is sometimes
really answered, than the hospital experiment proposed
by Sir Henry Thomson could possibly have done. In this
work we have a precise yearly statement of his receipts and
expenditures for many years. He never asked any one or allowed
any one to be asked, directly or indirectly, for a penny.
No subscriptions or collections were ever made; yet
from 1830 (when he married without any income whatever)
he has lived, brought up a family, and established institutions
which have steadily increased, till now four thousand orphan
children are educated and in part supported. It has happened
hundreds of times that there has been no food in his house
and no money to buy any, or no food or milk or sugar for the
children; yet he never took a loaf or any other article on
credit even for a day; and during the thirty years over which
his narrative extends, neither he nor the hundreds of children
dependent upon him for their daily food have ever been
without a regular meal! They have lived, literally, from
hand to mouth; and his one and only resource has been secret
prayer. Here is a case which has been going on in the
midst of us for forty years, and is still going on; it has been
published to the world for many years, yet a warm discussion
is carried on by eminent men as to the fact of whether prayer
is or is not answered, and not one of them exhibits the
least knowledge of this most pertinent and illustrative phenomenon!
The Spiritualist explains all this as a personal influence.
The perfect simplicity, faith, boundless charity and
goodness of George Müller, have enlisted in his cause beings
of a like nature; and his mediumistic powers have enabled
them to work for him by influencing others to send him money,
food, clothes, &#38;c., all arriving, as we should say, just in
the nick of time. The numerous letters he received with
these gifts, describing the sudden and uncontrollable impulse
the donors felt to send him a certain definite sum at a certain
fixed time—such being the exact sum he was in want of and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>had prayed for—strikingly illustrates the nature of the power
at work. All this might be explained away, if it were partial
and discontinuous; but when it continued to supply the
daily wants of a life of unexampled charity, <em>for which no provision
in advance was ever made</em> (for that Müller considered
would show want of trust in God), no such explanation can
cover the facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. Spiritualism enables us to comprehend and find a place
for that long series of disturbances and occult phenomena of
various kinds, which occurred previous to what are termed
the Modern Spiritual Manifestations. Robert Dale Owen’s
works give a rather full account of this class of phenomena,
which are most accurately recorded and philosophically treated
by him. This is not the place to refer to them in detail;
but one of them may be mentioned as showing how large
an amount of unexplained mystery there was, even in our
own country, before the world heard anything of Modern
Spiritualism. In 1841, Major Edward Moor, F. R. S., published
a little book called “Bealings Bells,” giving an account
of mysterious bell-ringing in his house at Great Bealings,
Suffolk, and which continued for fifty-three days. Every attempt
to discover the cause, by himself, friends, and bell-hangers,
were fruitless; and by no efforts, however violent,
could the same clamorous and rapid ringing be produced.
He wrote an account to the newspapers, requesting information
bearing on the subject, when, in addition to certain wise
suggestions—of rats or a monkey as efficient causes—he received
fourteen communications, all relating cases of mysterious
bell ringing in different parts of England, many of
them lasting much longer than Major Moor’s, and all remaining
equally unexplained. One lasted eighteen months; another
was in Greenwich Hospital, where neither clerk-of-the-works,
bell-hanger, nor men of science could discover the
cause. One clergyman wrote of disturbances of a most
serious kind continued in his parsonage for <em>nine years</em>, and
he was able to trace back their existence in the same house
for <em>sixty years</em>. Another case had lasted <em>twenty years</em>, and
could be traced back for a <em>century</em>. Some of the details of
these cases are most instructive. Trick is absolutely the
most incredible of all explanations. Spiritualism furnishes
the explanation by means of analogous facts occurring
every day, and forming part of the great system of phenomena
which demonstrates the spiritual theory. Major
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Moor’s book is very rare; but a good abstract of it is given
in Owen’s “Debatable Land,” pp. 239–258.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>MORAL TEACHINGS OF SPIRITUALISM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have now to explain the Theory of Human Nature,
which is the outcome of the phenomena taken in their entirety,
and is also more or less explicitly taught by the communications
which purport to come from spirits. It may be briefly
outlined as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Man is a duality, consisting of an organized spiritual
form, evolved coincidently with and permeating the physical
body, and having corresponding organs and developments.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Death is the separation of this duality, and effects no
change in the spirit, morally or intellectually.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Progressive evolution of the intellectual and moral nature
is the destiny of individuals; the knowledge, attainments
and experience of earth-life forming the basis of spirit-life.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Spirits can communicate through properly-endowed mediums.
They are attracted to those they love or sympathize
with, and strive to warn, protect, and influence them for
good, by mental impression when they cannot effect any
more direct communication; but, as follows from clause (2),
their communications will be fallible, and must be judged
and tested just as we do those of our fellow-men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing outline propositions will suggest a number
of questions and difficulties, for the answers to which readers
are referred to the works of R. D. Owen, Hudson Tuttle, Professor
Hare, and the records of Spiritualism <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">passim</span></i>. Here I
must pass on to explain with some amount of detail, how the
theory leads to a pure system of morality with sanctions far
more powerful and effective than any which either religious
systems or philosophy have put forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>This part of the subject cannot perhaps be better introduced
than by referring to some remarks by Professor Huxley
in a letter to the Committee of the Dialectical Society.
He says, “But supposing the phenomena to be genuine—they
do not interest me. If anybody would endow me with
the faculty of listening to the chatter of old women and curates
at the nearest cathedral town, I should decline the privilege,
having better things to do. And if the folk in the spiritual
world do not talk more wisely and sensibly than their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>friends report them to do, I put them in the same category.”
This passage, written with the caustic satire in which the
kind hearted Professor occasionally indulges, can hardly
mean that if it were proved that men really continued to live
after the death of the body, that fact would not interest him,
merely because some of them talked twaddle? Many scientific
men deny the spiritual source of the manifestations, on
the ground that real, genuine spirits might reasonably be expected
not to indulge in the commonplace trivialities which
do undoubtedly form the staple of ordinary spiritual communications.
But surely Professor Huxley, as a naturalist and
philosopher, would not admit this to be a reasonable expectation.
Does he not hold the doctrine that there can be no effect,
mental or physical, without an adequate cause? and
that mental states, faculties, and idiosyncrasies, that are the
result of gradual development and life-long—or even ancestral—habit,
cannot be suddenly changed by any known or
imaginable cause? And if (as the Professor would probably
admit) a very large majority of those who daily depart this
life are persons addicted to twaddle, persons who spend much
of their time in low or trivial pursuits, persons whose pleasures
are sensual rather than intellectual—whence is to come
the transforming power which is suddenly, at the mere
throwing off the physical body, to change these into beings
able to appreciate and delight in high and intellectual pursuits?
The thing would be a miracle, the greatest of miracles,
and surely Professor Huxley is the last man to contemplate
innumerable miracles as part of the order of nature;
and all for what? Merely <em>to save these people from the necessary
consequences of their misspent lives</em>. For the essential
teaching of Spiritualism is, that we are, all of us, in every act
and thought, helping to build up a “mental fabric,” which
will be and constitute ourselves, more completely after the
death of the body than it does now. Just as this fabric is
well or ill built, so will our progress and happiness be aided
or retarded. Just in proportion as we have developed our
higher intellectual and moral nature, or starved it by disuse
and by giving undue prominence to those faculties which secure
us mere physical or selfish enjoyment, shall we be well
or ill fitted for the new life we enter on. The noble teaching
of Herbert Spencer, that men are best educated by being left
to suffer the natural consequences of their actions, is the
teaching of Spiritualism as regards the transition to another
phase of life. There will be no imposed rewards or punishments;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>but every one will suffer the natural and inevitable
consequences of a well or ill-spent life. The well-spent life
is that in which those faculties which regard our personal
physical well-being are subordinated to those which regard
our social and intellectual well-being, and the well-being of
others; and that inherent feeling—which is so universal and
so difficult to account for—that these latter constitute our
higher nature, seems also to point to the conclusion that we
are intended for a condition in which the former will be almost
wholly unnecessary, and will gradually become rudimentary
through disuse, while the latter will receive a corresponding
development.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although, therefore, the twaddle and triviality of so many
of the communications is not one whit more interesting to
sensible Spiritualists than it is to Prof. Huxley, and is never
voluntarily listened to, yet the fact that such poor stuff is
talked (supposing it to come from spirits) is both a fact that
might have been anticipated and a lesson of deep import.
We must remember, too, the character of the séances at
which these commonplace communications are received. A
miscellaneous assemblance of believers of various grades and
tastes, but mostly in search of an evening’s amusement, and
of skeptics who look upon all the others as either fools or
knaves, is not likely to attract to itself the more elevated and
refined denizens of the higher spheres, who may well be supposed
to feel too much interest in their own new and grand
intellectual existence to waste their energies on either class.
If the fact is proved, that people continue to talk after they
are dead with just as little sense as when alive, but that, being
in a state in which sense, both common and uncommon,
is of far greater importance to happiness than it is here
(where fools pass very comfortable lives), they suffer the
penalty of having neglected to cultivate their minds; and
being so much out of their element in a world where all pleasures
are mental, they endeavor to recall old times by gossiping
with their former associates whenever they can find the
means—Prof. Huxley will not fail to see its vast importance
as an incentive to that higher education which he is never
weary of advocating. He would assuredly be interested in
anything having a really practical bearing on the present as
well as on the future condition of men; and it is evident that
even these low and despised phenomena of Spiritualism, “if
true,” have this bearing, and, combined with its higher teachings,
constitute a great moral agency which may yet regenerate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the world. For the Spiritualist who, by daily experience,
gets absolute knowledge of these facts regarding the
future state—who knows that, just in proportion as he indulges
in passion, or selfishness, or the exclusive pursuit of
wealth, and neglects to cultivate the affections and the varied
powers of his mind, so does he inevitably prepare for
himself misery in a world in which there are no physical
wants to be provided for, no sensual enjoyments except those
directly associated with the affections and sympathies, no
occupations but those having for their object social and intellectual
progress—is impelled toward a pure, a sympathetic,
and an intellectual life by motives far stronger than any
which either religion or philosophy can supply. He dreads
to give way to passion or to falsehood, to selfishness or to a
life of luxurious physical enjoyment, because he knows that
the natural and inevitable consequences of such habits are
future misery, necessitating a long and arduous struggle in
order to develop anew the faculties, whose exercise long disuse
has rendered painful to him. He will be deterred from
crime by the knowledge that its unforeseen consequences
may cause him ages of remorse; while the bad passions which
it encourages will be a perpetual torment to himself in a state
of being in which mental emotions cannot be laid aside or forgotten
amid the fierce struggles and sensual pleasures of a
physical existence. It must be remembered that these beliefs
(unlike those of theology) will have a living efficacy,
because they depend on <em>facts</em> occurring again and again in
the family circle, constantly reiterating the same truths as
the result of personal knowledge, and thus bringing home to
the mind, even of the most obtuse, the absolute reality of
that future existence in which our degree of happiness or
misery will be directly dependent on the “mental fabric” we
construct by our daily thoughts and words and actions here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Contrast this system of natural and inevitable reward and
retribution, dependent wholly on the proportionate development
of our higher mental and moral nature, with the arbitrary
system of rewards and punishments dependent on
stated acts and beliefs only, as set forth by all dogmatic religions,
and who can fail to see that the former is in harmony
with the whole order of Nature—the latter opposed to it. Yet
it is actually said that Spiritualism is altogether either imposture
or delusion, and all its teachings but the product of “expectant
attention” and “unconscious cerebration”! If none
of the long series of demonstrative facts which have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>here sketched out, existed, and its only product were this
theory of a future state, that alone would negative such a
supposition. And when it is considered that mediums of all
grades, whether intelligent or ignorant, and having communications
given through them in various direct and indirect
ways, are absolutely in accord as to the main features of this
theory, what becomes of the gross misstatement that nothing
is given through mediums but what they know and believe
themselves? The mediums have, almost all, been brought
up in some of the usual Orthodox beliefs. How is it, then,
that the usual Orthodox notions of heaven are <em>never</em> confirmed
through them?</p>

<p class='c007'>In the scores of volumes and pamphlets of spiritual literature
I have read, I have found no statement of a spirit describing
“winged angels,” or “golden harps,” or the “throne
of God”—to which the humblest orthodox Christian thinks
he will be introduced if he goes to heaven at all. There is no
more startling and radical opposition to be found between
the most diverse religious creeds, than that between the beliefs
in which the majority of mediums have been brought up
and the doctrines as to a future life that are delivered through
them; there is nothing more marvelous in the history of the
human mind than the fact that, whether in the back-woods
of America or in country towns in England, ignorant men
and women having almost all been brought up in the usual
sectarian notions of heaven and hell, should, the moment
they become seized by the strange power of mediumship,
give forth teachings on this subject which are philosophical
rather than religious, and which differ wholly from what had
been so deeply ingrained into their minds. And this statement
is not affected by the fact that communications purport
to come from Catholic or Protestant, Mahometan or Hindoo
spirits. Because, while such communications maintain special
<em>dogmas</em> and <em>doctrines</em>, yet they confirm the <em>very facts</em>
which really constitute the spiritual theory, and which in
themselves contradict the theory of the sectarian spirits.
The Roman Catholic spirit, for instance, does not describe
himself as being in either the orthodox purgatory, heaven, or
hell; the Evangelical Dissenter who died in the firm conviction
that he should certainly “go to Jesus,” never describes
himself as being with Christ, or as ever having seen him, and
so on throughout. Nothing is more common than for religious
people at séances to ask questions about God and Christ. In
reply they never get more than opinions, or more frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the statement that they, the spirits, have no more actual
knowledge of those subjects than they had while on earth.
So that the facts are all harmonious; and the very circumstance
of there being sectarian spirits bears witness in two ways
to the truth of the spiritual theory—it shows that the mind,
with its ingrained beliefs, is not suddenly changed at death;
and it shows that the communications are not the reflection
of the mind of the medium, who is often of the same religion
as the communicating spirit, and, because he does not get his
own ideas confirmed, is obliged to call in the aid of “Satanic
influence” to account for the anomaly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine of a future state and of the proper preparation
for it as here developed, is to be found in the works of all
Spiritualists, in the utterances of all trance-speakers, in the
communications through all mediums; and this could be
proved, did space permit, by copious quotations. But it varies
in form and detail in each; and just as the historian arrives
at the opinions or beliefs of any age or nation, by collating
the individual opinions of its best and most popular writers,
so do Spiritualists collate the various statements on the
subject. They know well that absolute dependence is to be
placed on no individual communications. They know that
these are received by a complex physical and mental process,
both communicator and recipient influencing the result; and
they accept the teachings as to the future state of man only
so far as they are repeatedly confirmed in substance (though
they may differ in detail) by communications obtained under
the most varied circumstances, through mediums of the most
different characters and acquirements, at different times and
in distant places. Fresh converts are apt to think that,
once satisfied the communications come from their deceased
friends, they may implicitly trust to them, and apply them
universally; as if the vast spiritual world was all molded to
one pattern, instead of being, as it almost certainly is, a thousand
times more varied than human society on the earth is,
or ever has been. The fact that the communications do not
agree as to the condition, occupations, pleasures, and capacities
of individual spirits, so far from being a difficulty, as has
been absurdly supposed, is what ought to have been expected;
while the agreement on the essential features of what we
have stated to be the spiritual theory of a future state of existence,
is all the more striking, and tends to establish that
theory as a fundamental truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The assertion so often made, that Spiritualism is the survival
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>or revival of old superstitions, is so utterly unfounded
as to be hardly worth notice. A science of human nature
which is founded on observed facts; which appeals only to
facts and experiment; which takes no beliefs on trust; which
inculcates investigation and self-reliance as the first duties of
intelligent beings; which teaches that happiness in a future
life can be secured by cultivating and developing to the utmost
the higher faculties of our intellectual and moral nature,
<em>and by no other method</em>—is and must be the natural enemy of
all superstition. Spiritualism is an experimental science, and
affords the only sure foundation for a true philosophy and a
pure religion. It abolishes the terms “supernatural” and
“miracle” by an extension of the sphere of law and the
realm of nature; and in doing so it takes up and explains
whatever is true in the superstitions and so-called miracles of
all ages. It, and it alone, is able to harmonize conflicting
creeds; and it must ultimately lead to concord among mankind
in the matter of religion, which has for so many ages
been the source of unceasing discord and incalculable evil;
and it will be able to do this because it appeals to evidence
instead of faith, and substitutes facts for opinions; and is
thus able to demonstrate the source of much of the teaching
that men have so often held to be divine.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will thus be seen that those who can form no higher conception
of the uses of Spiritualism, “even if true,” than to
detect crime or to name in advance the winner of the Derby,
not only prove their own ignorance of the whole subject, but
exhibit in a marked degree that partial mental paralysis, the
result of a century of materialistic thought, which renders so
many men unable seriously to conceive the possibility of a
natural continuation of human life after the death of the
body. It will be seen also that Spiritualism is no mere “physiological”
curiosity, no mere indication of some hitherto unknown
“law of nature”; but that it is a science of vast extent,
having the widest, the most important, and the most
practical issues, and as such should enlist the sympathies alike
of moralists, philosophers and politicians, and of all who have
at heart the improvement of society and the permanent elevation
of human nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>In concluding this necessarily imperfect though somewhat
lengthy account of a subject about which so little is probably
known to most of the readers of the Fortnightly Review, I
would earnestly beg them not to satisfy themselves with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>minute criticism of single facts, the evidence for which, in my
brief survey, may be imperfect; but to weigh carefully the
mass of evidence I have adduced, considering its wide range
and various bearings. I would ask them to look rather at the
results produced by the evidence than at the evidence itself
as imperfectly stated by me; to consider the long roll of men
of ability who, commencing the inquiry as skeptics, left it as
believers, and to give these men credit for not having overlooked,
during years of patient inquiry, difficulties which at
once occur to themselves. I would ask them to ponder well
on the fact, that no earnest inquirer has ever come to a conclusion
adverse to the reality of the phenomena; and that no
Spiritualist has ever yet given them up as false. I would ask
them, finally, to dwell upon the long series of facts in human
history that Spiritualism explains, and on the noble and satisfying
theory of a future life that it unfolds. If they will do
this, I feel confident that the result I have alone aimed at will
be attained; which is, to remove the prejudices and misconceptions
with which the whole subject has been surrounded,
and to incite to unbiased and persevering examination of the
facts. For the cardinal maxim of Spiritualism is, that every
one must find out the truth for himself. It makes no claim
to be received on hearsay evidence; but, on the other hand,
it demands that it be not rejected without patient, honest and
fearless inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a copious and popular but faithful summary of the phenomena

names connected with the scenes described are of such weight, that it
is impossible to deny the conviction impressed upon the mind that
either Spiritualism is one of the greatest delusions of the age, or that
it is indeed a new manifestation of supernatural power, deserving the

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
